  "text": "HOBBITON was a village in the Westfarthing of the Shire.\n\n\nHistory\n\nHobbiton was located in the center of the Shire in the far eastern part\nof the Westfarthing. It was the home of many illustrious Hobbits,\nincluding Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins, and Samwise Gamgee. Notable\nlocations in Hobbiton include the Mill and the Baggins' Hobbit-hole in\nthe hill, and Bag End. At the end of the War of the Ring, Saruman's\ntreachery destroyed much of the Shire, and Hobbiton suffered greatly.\nThe Old Mill had been replaced with a noxious factory-like structure,\nand many trees had been cut down.\n\nAfter the servants of Saruman had been expelled from the Shire, Sam\nGamgee used magic soil from the garden of the Elf-queen Galadriel to\nheal the Shire in general, but with particular attention to Hobbiton.",
