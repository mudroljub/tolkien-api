It was rumored that\nhe was a Half-orc and had been driven from Dunland. He was Saruman\nthe White's agent and was put in charge of the negotiation and purchase\nof Pipe-weed and other supplies for Isengard during the war. His orders\nwere also to penetrate the Shire further and learn of any departure of\nany important people recently. He was cornered with Bill Ferny in\nTharbad by the Nazg√ªl, where out of fear for his own life, he betrayed\nSaruman's own secrets about knowledge of the Shire.\n\nThe Southerner was in league with Bill Ferny and met him in Bree where\nhe told him who Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and Merry were. He was seen in\nFerny's house by the departing company as they were about to leave Bree.\nHe was also called the GOBLIN MAN.",
