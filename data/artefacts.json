The White Tree was also\nthe motif of Gondor's flag.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThis iconic tree was in appearance a tall spacious tree of graceful\nform, white thin unwrinkled bark over white wood. In spring it bore\nnumerous white flowers, but few of these ever fructified; what shape the\nfruit was is never described, nor is it considered to be edible. The\nleaves were laurel-like, dark green above and bright silver beneath. The\nwood when burned gives off a dense, choking, volumnious smoke that forms\na fog capable of burying an entire country in darkness for several days.\n\nIt was fashioned in the image of Telperion, elder of the Two Trees of\nValinor, originally. This image was given to the Elves of Kortirion in\nValinor and named Galathilion. From it a sapling was taken to Tol\nEressëa, named Celeborn. This in turn sired the tree Nimloth of Númenor,\nfelled by Sauron and burned on the altars.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFirst White Tree\n\nThe first White Tree of Gondor came from a fruit that Isildur, at great\npersonal risk, managed to steal from Nimloth the Fair, the White Tree of\nNúmenor, before that one was destroyed at Sauron's insistence. He\nsuffered many wounds at this mission, and he came near death, but when\nthe first leaf opened in the spring, Isildur was healed of his wounds.\n\nThis sapling was brought to Middle-earth on Isildur's ship, and it was\neventually planted in Minas Ithil before the house of Isildur. But when\nSauron returned to Middle-earth, he launched a sudden attack that\ncaptured Minas Ithil, and he destroyed the White Tree. Isildur escaped\ntaking with him again a sapling.\n\nSecond White Tree\n\nIn the Year 2 of the Third Age, Isildur plants the seedling of the White\nTree in Minas Anor.\n\nThis White Tree lasts until TA 1636, when the Great Plague hits Gondor,\nkilling among many others King Telemnar and his children.\n\nThird White Tree\n\nA third sapling is planted in TA 1640 by King Tarondor. This one lasts\nuntil the year 2852 and the death of the Ruling Steward Belecthor II.\n\nAt this time no seedling of the tree could be found. As a result it was\nleft standing after its death.\n\nFourth White Tree\n\nWhen Aragorn becomes king he discovers (with Gandalf's help) a sapling\nof the White Tree upon the slopes of Mindolluin, high above the city,\nwhich he reverently plants in its place. The dead tree is removed from\nthe court but is placed in the Tombs of the Kings with all the honour\nthat would normally be accorded a fallen monarch. In June of TA 3019 the\nsapling blooms.\n",

The finest of these pieces was the Nauglamír.\n\nThe Nauglamír was the second-greatest treasure of Doriath, prized above\nall but Beren and Lúthien's Silmaril. After the smiths of Belegost\nfinished their work on the Nauglamír, Thingol requested that the Dwarves\nof Nogrod set the Silmaril in it. The Nauglamír, now bearing the\nSilmaril was held to be the fairest object in Arda.\n\nEnthralled by its beauty and greedy for the Silmaril, the dwarves\ndemanded the necklace insisting that as dwarf work it belonged to them.\nThingol was unwilling to surrender the treasure and replies with an\nimpertinent answer. In their anger, the Dwarves slew him. Two escaped to\nNogrod and told a much different story to their kinsmen, persuading the\ncity to march on Doriath.\n\nAfter the Fall of Doriath, the Dwarves of Nogrod marched homewards with\nthe stolen Nauglamír and the rest of the treasures of that land but\nBeren, at the head of an army of Laiquendi and Ents slew the dwarves.\nThe treasure was cast into the Ascar save the Nauglamír, which Beren\ngave to Lúthien.\n\nAfter Beren and Lúthien's final deaths, the necklace was inherited by\ntheir son, Dior, who became the second King of Doriath. When the Sons of\nFëanor heard that the inheritor of the throne of Doriath, they demanded\nthat he surrender it to them or become their enemy. When he refused,\nthis brought about the Second Kinslaying as the Sons of Fëanor, seeking\nthe Silmaril in accordance with the Oath of Fëanor, attacked Doriath.\nDior's daughter, Elwing, escaped the kinslaying with the Nauglamír,\nfleeing to the Mouths of Sirion.\n\nIn the Third Kinslaying, the Sons of Fëanor attacked the Elven havens in\nthe Mouths of Sirion, still trying to obtain the Silmaril within the\nNauglamír but Elwing cast herself into the sea with it rather than\nsurrender the gem to Maedhros and Maglor. The Nauglamír was lost, while\nElwing and the Silmaril were saved by the Vala Ulmo.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn an earlier myth of First Age lore that preceded the final stories in\n_The Silmarillion_, namely the Lost Tale _The Nauglafring_, the\nNauglamír (named the NAUGLAFRING) is more important: the necklace\nbecomes caught behind a tree branch when Thingol is riding outside the\nGirdle of Melian and is attacked by the Dwarves.

Translated into English, it reads, “_Sting_ is my name; I am the\nspider's bane.” The Appendix of ''The Silmarillion _defines_ _the\nelement _maeg'' in Sindarin as meaning “sharp” or “piercing”. During the\nThird Age, it was wielded by Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins, and Samwise\nGamgee.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nSting was an ancient Elvish blade made by weapon-smiths in Gondolin.\nWhen Orcs or goblins were within an undetermined radius of it, the blade\nglowed blue, alerting the wielder and others who could see it to their\npresence. It had been lost during the Fall of Gondolin, the same battle\nin which Turgon fell and Glamdring was taken. It appeared as a curved\nblade with a silver loop or spiral design on it, later runes were added\nto it by Bilbo after his adventures. These runes seem to have been made\nby the Elves as they are in Sindarin.\n\nIn _The Hobbit_, Bilbo and his dwarven companions found Sting in a\nTroll-hoard alongside two other elven blades: Glamdring and Orcrist.\nThough just a dagger by the standard of elves, Sting made a perfect\nshort sword for a Hobbit, although it was still rather small, as Bilbo\ninitially chose to wear it “inside his breeches” and was still able\nto travel and even run without any apparent inconvenience.\n\nJust before his nephew embarked on his quest to Mordor from Rivendell,\nBilbo gave Sting to Frodo. Sam then took the weapon from his (seemingly\ndead) master and used it to good effect against Shelob on the borders of\nMordor. After the defeat of Sauron at the end of the Third Age, Frodo\nentrusted Sting to Sam and it became an heirloom of the Gamgee family.\n\nGollum, who disliked anything made by the Elves, was afraid of Sting.\nThis fear aided Bilbo when he confronted Gollum in the Cave at the base\nof the Misty Mountains in _The Hobbit_. It also helped Frodo and Sam\nsubdue Gollum in _The Lord of the Rings_. Orcs also had an instinctive\nfear of these weapons and hated any who carried them.\n\nAs is fitting for a blade of Gondolin, Sting could easily cut through\nthe webs of the offspring of Ungoliant, including the evil Shelob and\nthe spiders of Mirkwood. Bilbo had named the weapon _Sting_ after he had\n“stung” one of them with it. In The Hobbit when Bilbo wears the One\nRing, and defends himself against a spider, he names the blade “Sting”.\nThe narrator describes the spider's lack of acquaintance with creatures\nwith such stings, and evidently this was also Bilbo's presumption in\nnaming it as such. Sting was like Glamdring and Orcrist in that “being\nthe work of Elvish smiths in the Elder Days these swords shone with a\ncold light, if any Orcs were near at hand.” But only Sting was\ndefinitively described as glowing blue, or glittering with blue flame at\nits edges.\n",

They were made around the same\ntime as the Rings of Power and there were, presumably, many of them\nsince “In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings were made” and there are\nonly twenty Rings of Power, unless twenty is considered “many” rings.\nGandalf states that though the Elves who forged them thought little of\nthem, he still thinks they are dangerous for mortals.\n\nThey are lesser rings of the Rings of Power, forged by the Elves as\n“essays in the craft”- they bore no gem (similar to the One Ring).\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the ancient days of the Second Age, before the Fall of Númenor, many\nrings were forged, the craft being taught by Sauron. These rings aided\nin the use of spells and magical craft, and thus were widely popular\nwith the Elves. Sauron, then known as “Lord of the Gifts” claimed he\nwished to make Middle-earth as fair as Valinor, and it seemed he\nconvinced the elves to think these rings could do so.\n\nAfter the forging of the One Ring, Sauron began drawing these lesser\nrings to himself. This was not difficult, for the One Ring gave him the\nstrength to subdue the wielders of these powerful artifacts. Once\ngathered, Sauron could disperse them among his captains, making them all\nmighty champions whom he could back up at will with his own strength via\nthe magic ring connection. After the Last Alliance of Elves and Men and\nthe First Fall of Sauron, these rings were dispersed through the land.\nSome were taken from dead warriors, others, borne away by the\nfrightened, still living servants of Sauron, others were lost and little\nis known of what happened to them until the War of the Ring.\n\nAt the time of the War of the Ring, Sauron gathered again the lesser\nrings to himself. But this time, he kept a great deal of them so as to\nadvance his own abilities. Though not stated in the books or movies, it\nseems reasonable to believe that some were given again to his commanders\nas well, and logically some were lost or destroyed before they could be\nreclaimed. \n\nTheir ultimate fates are unknown, nor is it known whether or not their\npowers were bound to the power of the One Ring. If they were, then their\npower would have failed with the destruction of the One.\n\n\nPowers\n\nThe full extent of the rings' power is unknown, but Gandalf says that\n“none are to be used lightly”. They were, to an extent, like the One\nRing when it came to temptation. They would give a being strength,\nmagical ability, and the power to dominate other wills.\n\nIt is also believed (though again, not stated) that these rings also had\ncertain fields in which they were strongest. For example, one ring may\nrule over stone, while another controls ice. This, however, is not known\nfact, and only stems from what is known about the Rings of Power,\nassuming that the lesser rings are much like them."

    "text": "The TWO TREES OF VALINOR also known as the TREES OF THE VALAR,''' '''the\nTWO TREES: '''Laurelin '''(the Gold Tree) and '''Telperion '''(the\nSilver Tree), brought light into the Land of the Valar in ancient times.\nThey were destroyed by Melkor and Ungoliant, but their last flower and\nfruit were made by the Valar into the Sun and the Moon.\n\n\nCreation and destruction\n\nThe first sources of light for all of Arda were two enormous Lamps,\nIlluin, the silver one to the north, and Ormal, the golden one to the\nsouth. These were cast down and destroyed by Melkor. Afterward, the\nValar went to Valinor and Yavanna sang into existence the Two Trees,\nsilver Telperion and golden Laurelin. Telperion was considered male and\nLaurelin female. The Trees sat on the hill Ezellohar located outside\nValimar. They grew in the presence of all of the Valar, watered by the\ntears of Nienna.\n\n Each tree was a source of\nlight: Telperion's silver and Laurelin's gold. Telperion had dark leaves\n(silver on one side) and his silvery dew was collected as a source of\nwater and of light. Laurelin had gold-trimmed leaves and her dew was\nlikewise collected by Varda. One “day” lasted twelve hours. Each Tree,\nin turn, would give off light for seven hours (waxing to full brightness\nand then slowly waning again), so that at one hour each of “dawn” and\n“dusk” soft gold and silver light would be given off together.\n\nJealous, Melkor enlisted the help of the giant spider-creature Ungoliant\n(the mother of Shelob) to destroy the Two Trees. Concealed in Unlight,\nMelkor struck each Tree and the insatiable Ungoliant devoured whatever\nlife and light remained in them.\n\nAgain Yavanna sang and Nienna wept, but they succeeded only in reviving\nTelperion's last flower (to become the Moon) and Laurelin's last fruit\n(to become the Sun). These were assigned to lesser spirits, male Tilion\nand female Arien, after the 'genders' of the Trees themselves. This\nis why, in _The Lord of the Rings_, the Sun is usually referred to as\n“she” and the moon as “he”.\n\nHowever, the true light of the Trees, before their poisoning by\nUngoliant, was said to afterwards reside only in the Silmarils.\n\n\nTelperion's descendants\n\nBecause the Elves that first came to Valinor especially loved Telperion,\nYavanna made a second tree like it to stand in the city of Tirion where\nthe Vanyar and Ñoldor dwelt together at first. This tree,\nnamed Galathilion, was identical to Telperion except that it gave no\nlight of its own. It had many seedlings, one of which was planted in the\nisle of Tol Eressëa (named CELEBORN).\n\nIn the Second Age, a seedling of Celeborn was brought as a gift to the\nNúmenóreans - this was Nimloth, the White Tree of Númenor. It lasted\nthrough the majority of the realm's duration, but when Sauron took\ncontrol of the island he commanded King Ar-Pharazôn to chop it down.\n\nFortunately Isildur managed to save a single fruit of that tree. Of this\nfruit later came the White Tree of Gondor.\n\n\nInternal significance\n\nThe Two Trees of Valinor existed at a time when the only other source of\nlight was the stars (which had been created for the Elves' benefit by\nVarda from the dews collected from the Two Trees). When three Elven\nambassadors were brought to see Valinor for themselves, in order that\nthe Elves might be convinced to come to Valinor, it seems that the Two\nTrees affected them most significantly.\n\nIn particular Thingol is said to have been motivated in the Great\nJourney by his desire to see the Light of Valinor again (until he finds\ncontentment in the light he sees in Melian's face). Also in later times,\nthe Elves would be divided between the _CALAQUENDI_ who had seen the\nlight of the Trees, and the _MORIQUENDI_ who hadn't; with the former\ngroup having found enlightenment and near rapture in the light they\nbeheld.\n\nThe Silmarillion repeatedly states that those Elves who saw the Two\nTrees were mighty, with the light of Aman in their faces. As vassals of\nthe Valar, the trees somehow bestowed otherworldy power and\nunderstanding on those who were exposed to them. Galadriel in particular\nhad an affinity to Laurelin, as her hair was said to have captured the\ngolden light of that tree. In turn this inspired Feanor to make the\njewels that could hold that same light; the Silmarils.\n\nThe whole of the history of the First Age is strongly affected by the\ndesire of many different characters to possess the Silmarils, which\ncontain the only remaining unsullied light of the Trees. Yet upon his\nflight from Valinor after destroying the light of the Two Trees, Melkor\nstole the Silmarils and sparked the Oath of Fëanor (who renamed Melkor\nMorgoth) and after many years the Valar embarked on the War of Wrath,\nWhich ended the First Age\n\nIn the Second and Third Ages, the White Trees of Númenor and of Gondor,\nwhose likeness descends from that of Telperion, have a mostly symbolic\nsignificance. They stand both as symbols of the kingdoms in question,\nand also as reminders of the ancestral alliance between the Dúnedain and\nthe Elves. Even in this late age the two trees are remembered by some.\nGandalf obviously remembers them with reverence, as he speaks of them to\nPippin.\n\n\nExternal significance\n\nTolkien, as a Roman Catholic, would have been exposed to the\nsignificance of light in Catholic symbolism. Trees were of special\nimportance to him - in his short story _Leaf by Niggle_, which in a\nsense was an elaborate allegory explaining his own creative process, the\nprotagonist spends his life painting a single Tree.\n\nThe Two Trees represent the recurrent 'gold and silver' concept of the\nlegendarium. They are created after the lamps Ormal and Illuin - and\nfrom the trees themselves, the Sun and Moon are later created.\n\nTolkien may have also gotten inspiration for the trees directly from the\nSun, which rises in the day (as Laurelin, the golden tree), and the moon\nwhich rises in the night (Telperion, the silver tree).\n\n\nEtymology\n\nBoth Telperion and Laurelin are said to have been given many names among\nwhich are the following: Laurelin was also given the names of MALINALDA\nand CULÚRIEN,''' '''while Telperion was also named '''Silpion '''and\nNINQUELÓTË. Telperion's name in Valarin, the language of the Valar, is\nsaid to have been _IBRÎNIÐILPATHÂNEZEL_; Laurelin's name is recorded as\n_TULUKHEDELGORÛS._\n\nIn early writings of Tolkien, Telperion's names were SILPION ,\nBANSIL, and BELTHIL.\n\n\nQuotations\n\n“Yet even as hope failed  Telperion bore at last upon a leafless\nbough one great flower of silver, and Laurelin a single fruit of gold.”\n- _The Silmarillion_\n\n“... and perceive the unimaginable hand and mind of Feanor at their\nwork, while both the White Tree and Golden were in flower!” Gandalf to\nPippin, _The Two Towers_\n\n\nNotes\n\n-   Tolkien could have taken the creation of light mentioned in Genesis\n    as inspiration for the two trees, as both brought light into\n    Middle-earth and were turned into the moon and sun.",
