    "text": "ERIADOR was a large region situated in northwestern Middle-earth. It was\nlocated between the Blue Mountains (to the west) and the Misty Mountains\n(to the east).\n\n\nDescription and Climate\n\nAccording to _The Atlas of Middle-earth_, Eriador was about six-hundred\nmiles (approximately 965.5 kilometers) from east to west. It was\nmostly lowlands. Hill areas were mainly in around the realms of Arnor,\nthe Shire in the center of the region and in the far eastern parts near\nthe Misty Mountains. Plains and bottomlands were in the south and\nsouthwestern parts. A plateau area existed in the area where Rivendell\nand the Trollshaws were located. Eriador was largely made up of\nscattered woodlands with scrublands in the north and northeastern parts.\nThe rest were short grasslands mainly in the center of the region.\n\nThe climate was mainly humid with relatively mild to cold winters with a\nconstantly warm and moist prevailing wind blowing over the Blue\nMountains. In the northern part, cold and dry prevailing winds blow down\nfrom the polar north influencing the climate as well.\n\nMost of the population was concentrated in the center area around Arnor\nand the Shire and the dominant language was Westron at least by the\nThird Age.\n\nIts boundaries were:\n\n-   To the east, the Misty Mountains.\n-   To the north, the Ice-Bay of Forochel, which flooded part of the\n    lands of Morgoth after the War of Wrath.\n-   To the west, the Blue Mountains.\n-   To the south, the river Greyflood and the land of Enedwaith. After\n    the War of Wrath, part of the southwestern border lies along the\n    shores of Belegaer.\n\nImportant rivers were the Lune (Elvish _Lhûn_), the Brandywine or\n_Baranduin_ in Elvish and the Greyflood.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the Second Age, and possibly much earlier, it was largely forested,\nbut Men cleared the land for farming and the massive old forests never\nrecovered. Much of it was encompassed in the early Third Age by the\nkingdom of Arnor, which later split into the rival kingdoms of Rhudaur,\nArthedain and Cardolan. The Shire occupies part of the former Kingdom of\nArthedain, while Bree and its neighbouring villages lie on the border\nwith the former Cardolan. The Barrow-wights dwell within ancient burial\nmounds constructed in the First Age by the Edain as they journeyed to\nBeleriand. Other important places in Eriador are Rivendell and the\nabandoned kingdoms of Eregion and Angmar.\n\nAt the beginning of the Second Age, large populations of both regular\nMen and Dúnedain inhabited the region. There was also a group of\nNoldorin exiles living in Eregion, near Moria and also located in the\nwestern most region of Eriador (and also in Middle-earth) was the High\nElven Kingdom of Lindon, once the greatest and mightiest kingdom of\nMiddle earth. Sauron's assault on the Elves of Eregion laid waste to\nthat land, and many of the Elves of the Lindon fell in the War of the\nLast Alliance.\n\nEven after his fall, Sauron's evil spirit acted through his agents, such\nas the Witch-king of Angmar, and he also concocted virulent plagues\nwhich swept over the land. Between warfare against the surviving\nDúnedain kingdoms, the plagues, and the general lawlessness sweeping\nover the land, the population dropped considerably. The Angmar War\nturned Eriador into a beautiful, but mostly wild and untamed land, and\nthe only concentration of Elves was either in the valley of Rivendell or\nLindon.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_ERIADOR_ is a Sindarin word that meant 'Lonely land' or\n'Lone-lands'.",

    "page_id": "240",
    "text": "MINAS TIRITH  (IPA:\n) was the capital of Gondor in the Third Age and the Fourth Age of\nMiddle-earth. Originally known as MINAS ANOR, the “Tower of the Setting\nSun”, it replaced the city Osgiliath as the new capital and stockade of\nGondor.\n\nWhen the Enemy began to take shape again, Minas Anor was renamed Minas\nTirith, the “Tower of Guard.” The city was also called THE WHITE CITY,\nas the courtyard in the front of the city's Citadel contained the White\nTree. Many important events took place in and in front of the city, such\nas the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the healing of Éowyn by Aragorn\nafter the battle, and the coronation of Aragorn II Elessar.\n\n\nLayout\n\nMinas Tirith was surrounded by the Rammas Echor, a large ringwall\nencircling the city and the Pelennor Fields. This wall was built after\nMinas Ithil fell and was renamed Minas Morgul. It was repaired by\nEcthelion II during the time of the War of the Ring, but it had not the\nstrength to defend the city from the Dark Lord Sauron's legions of\nUruk-hai from Mordor. The city itself lay on a hill beneath Mount\nMindolluin, which rose above the city's citadel, by a length of a couple\nof thousand feet. Mount Mindolluin was where Aragorn found the seedling\nof the White Tree. \n\nThe city was divided into seven one-hundred-foot high levels, each\nsurrounded by white walls, except the first walls which had the same\nkind of black stone as Orthanc as a face. The gates connecting the\nlevels did not lay behind one another in a line, but faced in different\ndirections. A spur of rock, whose summit was level with the city's\nuppermost tier, jutted out from the front of the city in an easterly\ndirection, dividing all but the first level into two. Each level was\nscattered with many alleys, narrow passageways, and full-fledged houses\n(which were probably quite rare in the city). On the sixth level were\nlocated the Houses of Healing, surrounded by pleasant gardens. Finally,\nwithin the seventh wall, was the Citadel of Minas Tirith, with the White\nTower of Ecthelion - three hundred feet high, so that its apex was one\nthousand feet above the plain.\n\nLevels\n\n\n\nThe First Level of Minas Tirith was the lowest level of Minas Tirith\nwhere was the Main gate.\n\nDuring the Siege of Minas Tirith, Uruk-hai cast fire into the First\nLevel, burning many buildings and causing general havoc to many of the\ndefenders. Later on, the Main Gate was breached when Grond was finally\nused against it, and the soldiers of Gondor and Uruk-hai clashed in the\nstreets of the First Circle but Aragorn ordered a retreat and then made\ntheir way up.\n\n\nHistory\n\nMinas Tirith (as Minas Anor) was built in SA 3320. King Ostoher rebuilt\nthe city in TA 420, and, gradually, it became more important than\nOsgiliath, the original capital, which in later years fell into ruin.\nKing Tarondor finally moved the King's House to the city in TA 1640,\nthereby making it the official capital of the kingdom of Gondor. In the\nyear TA 2002, the White City's companion tower Minas Ithil (the “Tower\nof the Moon”) on the borders of Mordor was captured by the Ringwraiths\nand renamed Minas Morgul (the “Tower of Sorcery”). Minas Anor was then\nrenamed Minas Tirith, meaning the “Tower of Guard”, to indicate that,\nsince the fall of Minas Ithil, Minas Tirith was the only thing that\ndefended Gondor and all the other lands around and behind it against the\ndarkness from Mordor. The Rammas Echor, the great wall encircling the\nrich farmlands and suburbs of the City, was built at this time.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nMinas Tirith only has Gondorian soldiers while the civilians dwell in\nOsgiliath with several Gondorian soldiers. After the Uruk-hai attacked\nand overran Osgiliath a thousand soldiers were killed while the\nremaining thousand soldiers fled to Minas Tirith while the civilians\nwere evacuated to Rohan. The remaining gondorian soldiers entered\nOsgiliath and once the uruk-hai were slain the civilians departed from\nRohan and returned to Osgiliath.\n\nSiege of Minas Tirith\n\nMinas Tirith was besieged by the armies of Mordor, under the Great\nDarkness generated by Sauron's power. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields\ntook place on March 15, 3019 in the fields surrounding the city. It was\na very large battle. Theoden, the King of Rohan was killed during this\nbattle by the Witch-king of Angmar. At about the same time, the\nWitch-king was destroyed by Éowyn, lady of Rohan, who was severely\nwounded in the process. It was also there that Gandalf took command of\nthe City's defenses from the Ruling Steward Denethor after he fell to\ndespair. Aragorn later arrived at the hour of need with Gondor's Army of\nthe South which he had liberated from defending the port city of\nPelargir, turning the tide of battle in favor of the Free Peoples. After\nthe battle, the stench of death was heavy in Minas Tirith's air, and the\nPelennor Fields lay strewn with bodies.\n\nFourth Age\n\nOn 1 May 3019, the Crowning of King Elessar took place on the plain\noutside Minas Tirith. After his coronation, he entered the city as the\nKing of Gondor, as he was destined to become from the start of his\nlifetime. With his coronation, King Elessar refounded the line of the\nKings of Gondor, and as he was also the King of the Kingdom of Arnor,\nMinas Tirith became Capital of the Reunited Kingdom.\n\nMinas Tirith was repaired by its new king (who grew plants inside of its\nwalls to add to its luster and beauty) and by the Dwarves of Glittering\nCaves, particularly Gimli, who built a new gate for the city (made of\nmithril and steel) and altogether fixed the layout of the city as well.\nMinas Tirith was said to have been made even more beautiful than when it\nwas at the time of its founding. The city is known to have stood firm\nand strong well into the Fourth Age because of these two renovations.\n\nIn _The Silmarillion_, as Of The Ring Of Power And The Third Age says,\nafter War of the Ring, the city is referred to as Minas Anor again after\nthe overthrow of Sauron and the destruction of Barad-dûr.\n",

    "text": "The WHITE MOUNTAINS or ERED NIMRAIS was a mountain range in\nMiddle-earth that lay east-to-west across the length of Gondor.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe mountains were named after the glaciers of their highest peaks. The\nrange lay mostly East-West, but also had a northern section, which was\nseparated from the main line of the Misty Mountains by the Gap of Rohan.\nEven at the southern latitude of Gondor and Rohan, the White Mountains\nbore snow even in summer, suggesting they were extremely high. The range\nhad no passes. The Paths of the Dead passed under it, but only the most\ncourageous (or foolhardy) ever ventured that route. The White Mountains\nformed the northern boundary of Gondor and the southern boundary of\nRohan except in their easternmost provinces, where Gondor's province of\nAnorien lay to the north of the mountains.\n\nBecause of their always bearing snow at their highest peaks, the White\nMountains must have been at least 4800 meters (16'000 feet) above sea\nlevel, with occasional peaks probably in excess of 5500 meters. They\nwere, however, not as high as the Misty Mountains.\n\nIts notable peaks included _Irensaga_ “Iron Saw” and _Starkhorn_.\nBetween these two lay the _Dwimorberg_, entrance to the Paths of the\nDead.\n\nAt the eastern end, the city of Minas Tirith was carved into\n_Mindolluin_ mountain. The Warning beacons of Gondor were placed on top\nof seven peaks in the range: _Amon Dîn_, _Eilenach_, _Nardol_, _Erelas_,\n_Min-Rimmon_, _Calenhad_ and _Halifirien_.\n\nSeveral rivers raised in the White Mountains, among them: the Adorn (a\ntributary of Isen), and the Snowbourn and Mering Stream (tributaries of\nthe Entwash); and, on the south side, the Erui (a tributary of Anduin),\nthe Ringló and its tributary Ciril (which together with the Morthond all\nentered the Bay of Belfalas at Edhellond near Dol Amroth), the Lefnui of\nthe Anfalas, and the Five Rivers of Lebennin.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe natives to the White Mountains were Drúedain who inhabited this\nregion in the Second Age. The only remnants of the Druedain's presence\nin this mountain range were their statues called the _Púkel-men_.\nSometime thereafter, evil men related to the Dunlendings drove the\nDrúedain out. Some of these men swore allegiance to Isildur, but\nbetrayed him and were cursed into the Army of the Dead. Aragorn,\nLegolas, and Gimli followed the Paths of the Dead in year 3019 of the\nThird Age and convinced the army to fight for Gondor in the War of the\nRing. After they did so, Aragorn released the Army of the Dead, for they\nhad fulfilled their oath. After and perhaps before the War of the Ring\nDwarves settled in the White Mountain, where they could have better\ncontact with their allies.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_ERED NIMRAIS_ is a Sindarin name: _Ered_ ('Mountains') and _Nimrais_\n('White peaks')",

    "text": "The MISTY MOUNTAINS, also named the _HITHAEGLIR_ , was a mountain range that\nran 1280 kilometres (795.35 miles) from north to south between Eriador\nand the valley of the Great River, Anduin, and from Mount Gundabad in\nthe far north to Methedras in the south.\n\nAn early version of this range's name was _ERED HITHUI_ .\n\n\nGeographical description\n\n\n\nThe range's notable peaks were Caradhras, Celebdil, Fanuidhol, Mount\nGundabad, and Methedras.\n\nLocation\n\nThe northernmost peak of the Misty Mountains was Mount Gundabad; where\naccording to legend Durin (eldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves)\nawoke, though it became an abode and mountain-fortress of Orcs.\n\nThe greatest Dwarven realm in Middle-Earth, Khazad-dûm (later named\nMoria), was located at the midpoint of the Misty Mountains. The three\npeaks that were part of Khazad-dûm were Caradhras (Redhorn), Celebdil\n(Silvertine) and Fanuidhol (Cloudyhead). Inside Celebdil, the Dwarves\nbuilt the Endless Stair, from the foundations of the mountain to the top\nof it. The southernmost peak of the Misty Mountains was Methedras,\nmeaning “the Last Peak”.\n\nRoutes through the Misty Mountains\n\nThe most important passes were the High Pass and the Redhorn Pass. There\nwas also a pass at the source of the Gladden river.\n\nRoutes around the Misty Mountains\n\nThe Gap of Rohan was the valley (probably of the River Isen) between the\nsouthernmost peaks of the Misty Mountains and the northernmost of the\nWhite Mountains. There may have been a gap between Mount Gundabad in the\nMisty Mountains and the westernmost extremity of the Grey Mountains,\nthough published maps differ on this point. \n\nInhabitants\n\nUnder the Misty Mountains were the former Dwarf realm of Khazad-dum, and\nthe “Goblin-town” in which Bilbo Baggins stumbled across the One Ring,\nwhich had been in the possession of the creature Gollum, who also dwelt\nthere himself on the eastern side. Rivendell was hidden in the foothills\nof the Misty Mountains at the western end of the High Pass.\n\nCarn Dûm, where the Witch-King of Angmar resided for several centuries\nin the Third Age, lay between a western spur of the northern extreme of\nthe range, known as the Mountains of Angmar. Mount Gundabad, the largest\nGoblin dwelling in the Misty Mountains, was located south-east of\nAngmar.\n\nIsengard lay centered around the Tower of Orthanc in Nan Curunír, the\nvalley between the arms of Methedras, which was the southernmost peak of\nthe Misty Mountains. The “stone-giants” also inhabited this mountain\nrange, as told in _The Hobbit_.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nThe Misty Mountains were created by Melkor during the Time of the Trees,\nwho wanted to make it difficult for Oromë, who often rode across\nMiddle-earth hunting his fell beasts, to pass.\n\nYears of the Trees\n\nThe Dwarves of Durin awoke under Mount Gundabad and later established\nthe caves of Khazad-dûm. Later, when the Elves on their Great Journey to\nValinor looked upon their terrible height a portion of the Teleri, later\nknown as the Nandor grew afraid and turned south down the Great River.\nThousands of years later, the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth and\nestablished great realms in the Beleriand and in the highlands, but they\nnever crossed the mountains or established realms within them.\n\nFirst and Second Ages\n\nOver three-hundred years into the First Age, the tribes of Men crossed\nthe Misty Mountains and began migrating into the Beleriand, first the\nEdain and then later the Easterlings or Swarthy Men. After the defeat of\nMorgoth, the surviving orcs and a Balrog came to live there and would\nremain a problem for over six-thousand years. The Easterling men who\nfought with Morgoth crossed the mountains and began living east of the\nWilderland in Rhûn. The Great Eagles also began living here in a place\nknown as the Eagles Eyrie.\n\nThe great Dwarven realm of Khazad-dûm beneath the Misty Mountains\nthrived as good relations with the Ñoldor of Eregion were established,\nuntil Sauron invaded Eriador from Mordor and the east destroying Eregion\nand ravaging the lands beyond. The dwarves survived by shutting\nthemselves in Khazad-dûm behind the Doors of Durin.\n\nThird Age\n\nIn TA 1980, the great Dwarven realm of Khazad-dûm came to an end when\nthe Dwarves unearthed a Balrog which led to its desertion by TA 1981,\nafter which it was known as Moria (literally, “black chasm”). Slowly,\nthe Misty Mountains became increasingly perilous and dangerous to\ntravelers as Goblins and other creatures came to dwell under there.\n\nAlmost a thousand years later, the thirteen Dwarves, Gandalf, and Bilbo\nBaggins used the High Pass to cross the Misty Mountains during the Quest\nfor the Lonely Mountain, and were captured by Goblins whilst crossing.\nUnder the mountains, the Great Goblin was slain, and Bilbo found the One\nRing.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring tried to cross the Redhorn Pass (after\nrejecting the High Pass leading to Rhovanion as being watched by the\nEnemy, and the Gap of Rohan as taking the Fellowship too close to\nIsengard), but a blizzard forced it to go under the mountain instead of\nover it. They faced a Balrog that dwelt in the deserted realm of\nKhazad-dûm. Gandalf slew the Balrog by casting it down from Zirakzigil,\nbut it had worn his life already, and on that high ground he lay until\nGwaihir bore him to Lothlorien.",

    "text": "DUNLAND was the land of the wild men, or 'Dunlendings'. _Dunland_ means\n_Hill Land_ in the language of neighboring Rohan, whose people named it\nafter arriving in nearby Calenardhon in the later Third Age.\n\n\nInhabitants\n\nDunland was inhabited by the Dunlendings, Men who were mostly bearded\nand had dirty faces, and long matted hair. They wore clothes of leather\nand animal skin and carried weapons that were simple but effective for\ntheir purpose. They usually fought with clubs and pitchforks, and at\ntimes they carried torches to act as lights at night and to burn\nbuildings by day. The buildings that Dunlendings lived and worked in\nwere crude shacks of wood and animal skin that were often sabotaged by\nWargs and sometimes the Rohirrim.\n\nThe vernacular of this land's inhabitants, including possibly the\nStoors, was Dunlendish.\n\nAncestors of the Dunlendings inhabited the forested regions of\nMiddle-earth on either side of the Gwathló in the early Second Age; thus\nthe early Númenóreans called them _Gwaithuirim_. They spoke a language\nrelated to that of the Second House of Men, the Haladin, rather than the\nvastly different Bëorian-Marachian tongue which stood at the base of\nAdûnaic, and this lack of mutual understanding led to outright\nhostility. The Númenóreans greedily harvested _Gwaithuirim_ forests for\ntimber, and after much war and bloodshed, the _Gwaithuirim_ from south\nof the Gwathló fled east to the Hithaeglir while others scattered to the\ncape of Eryn Vorn and the White Mountains.\n\nAt the end of the Second Age, the land north of the Gwathló and south of\nthe Baranduin was named Minhiriath “Land between the Rivers”, although\nthe land south of Minhiriath remained unnamed. Its inhabitants were\nlargely ignored despite the fact that the Gondor colonial city of\nTharbad grew up on the Gwathló west of the Misty Mountain hillfolk who\nhad been _Gwaithuirim_ long before. It was not until Gondor abandoned\nthis city in TA 2050 that the people and their land were renamed: both\nbecame known as Enedwaith “Middle-Folk, Middle Region”, because they\nowed no allegiance to the North or South Kingdom.\n\nThe Hillfolk of the Hithaeglir kept their hatred of the descendants of\nNúmenor (unlike those of Eryn Vorn and the White Mountains, who\nnevertheless remained uncooperative). The Dead Men of Dunharrow who\nbetrayed Isildur were descended from _Gwaithurim_.\n\nIn T.A. 2770, Smaug the Dragon destroyed the Kingdom under the Mountain.\nDwarves fleeing from this disaster settled in Dunland, from\nwhere Thrór departed when he and his companion Nár journeyed\nto Moria in T.A. 2790. After the Battle of Azanulbizar, provoked by\nthe Orcs' brutal slaying of Thrór, Thráin II and Thorin led the remnants\nof their followers back to Dunland but soon left (to eventually settle\nin the Blue Mountains).\n\nWhen Gondor decided to give the depopulated province of Calenardhon to\nthe numerous people of Éothéod in TA 2510, the Hillfolk of the\nHithaeglir felt threatened by these _Forgoil_ “Strawheads” (a demeaning\nreference to the blonde hair of the refugees from Calenardhon). The\nHillfolk had slowly colonised Calenardhon during the dwindling of the\nDúnedain and had already reclaimed all the land between the Adorn and\nIsen. Still, open war was not waged until the reign of Helm Hammerhand\n(TA 2741 - TA 2759). Freca, the Lord of the Hillmen (whom the Rohirrim\nnow called Dunlendings) tried to get the throne of Rohan for himself by\npetitioning for the marriage of his son Wulf to the daughter of Helm.\nThe Hill-men leader Freca was killed and Wulf led the Dunlendings into\nopen war with Rohan. They unsuccessfully besieged the Hornburg during\nthe Long Winter of TA 2758 - TA 2759. Wulf did take Edoras and killed\nHaleth, the son of Helm, in front of the golden hall of Meduseld.\nNonetheless, Helm's nephew Fréalaf held out against the Dunlendings in\nthe refuge of Dunharrow. He recaptured Edoras at the end of the Long\nWinter and killed Wulf personally. The Dunlendings were driven out of\nRohan, and Fréalaf succeeded the deceased Helm Hammerhand.\n\nGuarding the Gap of Rohan was the fortress of Isengard, where a\nhereditary guard watched for Gondor. However, by the time of the Steward\nof Gondor Beren, these guards had mixed with Dunlendings, and it had\nbecome hostile to Gondor.

The\nwestern parts were built to facilitate the passage of companies of Dwarf\ncraftsmen (and later, their armed escort) across eastern Beleriand,\nbefore the Sack of Doriath by the dwarfs of Nogrod ended their trade.\n\n\n\nFirst Age\n\nAfter the First Age, and the ruination of Nogrod and neighbouring\nBelegost, focus shifted to the eastern part of the ancient road, which\nhad been built by the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm in the Misty Mountains.\nKhazad-dûm's inhabitants, the Longbeard dwarves, continued to grow in\npower and influence, and their trading needs meant that the road from\nthe Iron Hills that traveled through Mirkwood to their gates became\nwidely known. On the western side of the Misty Mountains, after\ntraversing the High Pass, the road continued to the Blue Mountains, and\nthis part ultimately became known as the MEN-I-NAUGRIMOR (“Old Dwarf\nRoad”). When the Númenórean realm in exile of Arnor was founded, the\nArnorians took over the maintenance of the Men-i-Naugrim, and built\nseveral fortresses on or near it (including Weathertop), and expanded or\ncreated bridges over the rivers Brandywine and Mitheithel. After Arnor\nwas divided in TA 861, the Great East Road formed the boundary between\ntwo of its successor states, Cardolan and Rhudaur.\n\nThird Age\n\nBy the time of the War of the Ring in the late Third Age, where the\nGreat East Road met the Greenway lay the ancient village of Bree. A days\nride east lay The Forsaken Inn, beyond which lay Rivendell.

Melkor built\nand delved many subterranean halls and dungeons of obsidian, fire and\nice beneath it .\n\n\nHistory\n\nWhen the world was young and Arda was bathed in the light of the two\nlamps Illuin and Ormal, Melkor first dug the great Pits of Utumno deep\nbeneath the mountains of the North. The fortress was constructed in the\nNorth in the Iron Mountains over one thousand miles from the later\nlocation of Angband, where the light of the lamps was almost\nnonexistent.\n\nHere were gathered all the evil powers of the World under the Lord of\nDarkness. Their numbers were vast, and Melkor had twisted many beautiful\nthings into horrifying and dreadful forms. Many of the great evils of\nthe world were bred in this place, such as trolls, “made in mockery of\nthe ents” as stated by Treebeard. It is probable that the Orcs were\nfirst bred here also, by the mutilating and corruption of lost Elves.\nCruel spirits, phantoms, wraiths, and evil demons stalked the halls of\nUtumno and haunted the surrounding forests. All were under the command\nof Melkor and his fallen Maiar servants; Gothmog the Lord of the Balrogs\nand Sauron the Sorcerer.\n\nFrom Utumno, Melkor poisoned and interfered with all the Valar's work\ndone during the Spring of Arda. Soon afterwards, Melkor and his servants\nwaged his war against the lamps of the Valar and struck them down,\nruining the world, and forcing the Valar to move further west to the\ncontinent of Aman.\n\nUtumno endured for many more millennia well into the early years of the\nElves at Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees when Middle-earth lay\nin the light of stars. Taking advantage of the new arrivals, Melkor\ncaptured some of them and thus, the hideous race of orcs was bred.\nKnowing that Melkor would continue to be a blight upon the world, the\nValar decided to protect the elves by ending his power in the north.\nAmidst the sounding of the trumpets, the Valar came out of the west, and\nafter the Battle of the Powers Utumno was besieged and destroyed in VY\n1099 , and Melkor was chained for about three thousand years.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_UTUMNO_ was the Quenya word for “Underworld”, also known as UDÛN\n(Sindarin for 'Hell').\n\n\nEarlier versions of the legendarium\n\nEarlier texts referred to Utumno as the FORTRESS OF THE NORTH or\n_UTUMNA_.\n\nAlso, its location had once been north of the Iron Mountains rather than\nwithin them.",

It was destroyed at the\nconclusion of the War of Wrath. \n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nAngband was a primarily subterranean stronghold under the three volcanic\nmountains of Thangorodrim, the largest mountains in Middle-earth. Before\nthe Great Gate, there was a somber court area flanked by frightening\ncliffs and walled by the towers of a great battlement. Through the gate,\nthere was a long great tunnel leading to a 'labyrinthine pyramid' of\nstairs to corridors, tunnels, and smithy chambers. A tall chimney went\nfrom Morgoth's gigantic blast furnaces and smithies, up through the\nmountain to the smokey towers of Thangorodrim. There were also many\ntunnels leading to the slave quarters or vaults. At the foundation of\nAngband was the entrance to Morgoth's throne room in the Nethermost\nHall. There were also mines within Angband that extended deeper than\nMorgoth's throne room.\n\n\nHistory\n\nMelkor originally built Angband to guard against a possible attack from\nAman by the Valar, and placed it under the command of Sauron. However,\nat the initiation of the War of Powers, the assault of the Valar leveled\nAngband without much difficulty, and forced Melkor to flee to his\nprimary stronghold of Utumno. However, Angband's underground vaults and\ncaverns were left relatively intact after the Valar's onslaught, as they\nwere in great haste to capture Melkor for the sake of keeping the\nnewly-awakened Elves safe. After Melkor's defeat at Utumno, the Balrogs\ncame to Angband and went into hibernation in its ruined foundations.\nEventually, the Orcs began to multiply in great numbers in Angband's\nruins, and soon made their way south into Beleriand, threatening the\nDwarves and Thingol's kingdom. It is possible that Sauron remained in\nthe ruins of Angband with the Balrogs, as he had presumably been\ncommanding the fortress when it was attacked. However, it is not certain\nwhere Sauron dwelt during Melkor's imprisonment. After three ages,\nMelkor was released, destroyed the Two Trees of Valinor, stole the\nSilmarils and escaped from Aman.\n\nAfter fleeing, Melkor, now named _Morgoth_ by his enemies, returned to\nMiddle-earth and re-delved the ruins of Angband, raising the\nvolcanic peaks of Thangorodrim over it. These peaks were created from\nthe slag and rubble caused by the re-delving of the fortress, and as\nsuch, it is likely that the rebuilt Angband extended for a considerably\ngreater distance underground than it's original incarnation had. From\nhis dark throne in the Nethermost Hall, Morgoth directed the war against\nthe Ñoldor who had returned from the West, and all the Free Peoples that\nsupported them in Beleriand. Ultimately, he achieved complete victory\nover them. At the end of the First Age, the Valar took pity on the\nÑoldor and instigated the War of Wrath, which not only utterly destroyed\nAngband but broke most of northern Middle-earth so throughly that it\nsank beneath the ocean.\n\n\nEarlier versions of the legendarium\n\nIn earlier versions of Tolkien's mythology (see _The History of\nMiddle-earth_) Angband was called ANGAMANDO, which is the Quenya form of\nthe name.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Angband_ is a Sindarin word that meant 'iron prison'.",

It was founded by\nTurgon the Wise, a Ñoldorin lord in the early First Age. It endured the\nlongest of all the Ñoldorin kingdoms in exile, lasting nearly\nfour-hundred years of the Sun.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nAs recounted in _The Silmarillion_, the Vala Ulmo, the Lord of Waters,\nrevealed the location of the Vale of Tumladen to the Noldorin Lord\nTurgon in a dream around the year FA 50. Under this divine guidance,\nTurgon travelled from his kingdom in Nevrast and found the vale in FA\n53. Within the Encircling Mountains just west of Dorthonion and east of\nthe river Sirion, lay a round level plain with sheer walls on all sides\nand a ravine and tunnel leading out to the southwest known as the Hidden\nWay. In the middle of the vale there was a steep hill which was called\nAmon Gwareth. There Turgon decided to found a great city that would be\nprotected by the mountains and hidden from the Dark Lord Morgoth.\n\nFor nearly seventy-five years, Turgon and his people built Gondolin in\nsecret. After it was completed in FA 116, he took with him to dwell in\nthe hidden city his entire people in Nevrast — almost a third of the\nÑoldor — as well as nearly three quarters of the northern Sindar. The\ncity stood for nearly 400 years until it was betrayed to Morgoth by\nMaeglin, Turgon's nephew, and sacked shortly thereafter by the Dark\nLord's forces.\n\n\n\nGondolin was described as this - “Now the streets of Gondolin were paved\nwith stone and wide, kerbed with marble, and fair houses and courts amid\ngardens of bright flowers were set about the ways, and many towers of\ngreat slenderness and beauty builded of white marble and carved most\nmarvelously rose to the heaven. Squares there were lit with fountains\nand the home of birds that sang amid the branches of their aged trees,\nbut of all these the greatest was that place where stood the King's\npalace, and the tower thereof was the loftiest in the city, and the\nfountains that played before the doors shot twenty fathoms and seven in\nthe air and fell in a singing rain of crystal; therein did the sun\nglitter splendidly by day, and the moon most magically shimmered by\nnight. The birds that dwelt there were of the whiteness of snow and\ntheir voices sweeter than a lullaby of music.”\n\n\nSpecifications\n\nThe Hidden Way was protected by seven gates, all constantly guarded; the\nfirst of wood, then stone, Bronze, Iron, Silver, Gold, and Steel.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIt was originally called _ONDOLINDË_, which is Quenya for “The Rock of\nthe Music of Water”, after the springs of Amon Gwareth.

    "text": "LOND DAER ENEDH (also spelt ENED) was a great harbour in Eriador.\n\n\nHistory\n\nLond Daer, under the name VINYALONDË, or 'New Haven', was founded by\nNúmenor's crown prince Aldarion on the estuary of the river Gwathló in\nthe early Second Age. It was the first permanent settlement of the\nNúmenóreans in Middle-earth. From here Aldarion's “Guild of Venturers”\nbegan harvesting the local timber for the shipbuilding industry of\nNúmenor.\n\nWithin a few centuries, the deforestation of the outlying regions\nEnedwaith and Minhiriath became cataclysmic, angering the local native\npopulation (ancestors of the Dunlendings), and they began to fight back\nwith increasing ferocity, destroying the haven several times, and\nfrequently burning the great wood-stores in 'hit-and-run' attacks.\n\nBy the time of the War of the Elves and Sauron in the middle of the\nSecond Age, this 'New Haven' had become very well established, and its\nname had shifted over the intervening one thousand years to 'Lond Daer',\nthe Great Haven. As such, it was one of the two beachheads of the\nNúmenórean forces in Eriador that were used to support the elves around\nSA 1700.\n\nLond Daer's shipyards were starved of timber following the war, as the\nforces of Sauron had burnt almost all of what remained in Enedwaith and\nMinhiriath. Once its shipbuilding yards were no longer practicable, Lond\nDaer declined in importance, and the Númenórean hunger for ever more\nwealth shifted focus to the establishment of newer havens to the south,\nPelargir and Umbar. Following this, Lond Daer was once again renamed,\nbeing now one of several major ports in Middle-earth, and was known as\nLOND DAER ENEDH, or 'Great Middle Haven'. Despite this, Númenor still\nmaintained traffic on the Gwathló as far as the city of Tharbad.\n\nAfter the Downfall of Númenor, Elendil founded the realm of Arnor in the\nlands north of Lond Daer, but the haven was now redundant, and fell into\nruin. Instead, control over the region was maintained from Tharbad. The\nancient ruins of Lond Daer were still visible as late as the end of the\nThird Age, however, and still featured on maps from that time.",

    "text": "'''Orthanc '''was the black, impenetrable tower of Isengard built by the\nDúnedain. By the Great Years and the War of the Ring it was possessed by\nthe wizard Saruman the White. It stood in the centre of the Ring of\nIsengard, surrounded by great defensive walls fortified by the early Men\nof Gondor.\n\n\nDescription\n\n''“A great ring-wall of stone, like towering cliffs, stood out from the\nshelter of the mountain-side, from which it ran and then returned\nagain... one who passed in and came at length out of the echoing tunnel,\nbeheld a plain, a great circle, somewhat hollowed like a vast shallow\nbowl: a mile it measured from rim to rim. Once it had been green and\nfilled with avenues, and groves of fruitful trees, watered by streams\nthat flowed from the mountains to a lake. But no green thing grew there\nin the latter days of Saruman. The roads were paved with stone-flags\ndark and hard; and beside their borders instead of trees there marched\nlong lines of pillars, some of marble, some of copper and of iron,\njoined by heavy chains, to the centre all the roads ran between their\nchains. There stood a tower of marvelous shape. It was fashioned by the\nbuilders of old, who smoothed the Ring of Isengard, and yet it seemed a\nthing not made by the craft of Men, but riven from the bones of the\nearth in the ancient torment of the hills. A peak and isle of rock it\nwas, black and gleaming hard: four mighty piers of many-sided stone were\nwelded into one, but near the summit they opened into gaping horns,\ntheir pinnacles sharp as the points of spears, keen-edged as knives.\nBetween them was a narrow space, and there upon a floor of polished\nstone, written with strange signs, a man might stand five hundred feet\nabove the plain.” ''\n\n- Orthanc as depicted by J.R.R Tolkien\n\nThe tower was constructed out of four piers of stone and then hardened\nby an unknown process. No weaponry or magic that existed on Arda was\nknown to be able to harm it. Until the Ents that besieged Isengard\nduring the War of the Ring managed to inflict slight damage on the\ntower, but their efforts ultimately proved to be futile. When Grima\nthrew the Orthanc stone it fell on the stairs; the rail snapped and part\nof the staircase broke.\n\nThe only entrance to the tower was reached by a stair of twenty-seven\nsteps, the door could only be opened with the Keys of Orthanc. Above the\ndoor there was a balcony, and many tall windows higher up.\n\n\nHistory\n\nSecond Age\n\n\n\nThe exact date of construction of Orthanc and establishment of Isengard\nis unknown; however it must have been built between SA 3320, the time of\nthe establishment of Arnor and Gondor, and SA 3430, when the Last\nAlliance of Elves and Men was formed. Within the fortified walls of the\ntower was placed one of the Palantíri, the Stone of Orthanc. Thus,\nOrthanc was now known as one of the seven towers of the Dúnedain,\nhousing the seventh seeing stone brought back from Númenor by Elendil.\n\nThird Age\n\nOrthanc suffered greatly during the Great Plague of TA 1636, and many of\nthe Númenóreans that inhabited it gradually migrated eastward.\nEventually the tower itself became deserted and its keys being moved to\nMinas Tirith to be kept by the Stewards of Gondor.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Field of Celebrant in TA 2510, a small group of\nMen of Gondor travelled to Isengard and maintained the fortress on their\nown. However, the Keys of Orthanc still officially belonged to the\nStewards of Gondor.\n\nOver time, Orthanc lost its connections with Minas Tirith and the Men of\nGondor failed to maintain the tower successfully. The Dunlendings then\ntook over the fortress and launched many attacks on the Westfold. In the\nLong Winter of TA 2754, the Dunlendings were eventually starved out due\nto the famine caused by the lack of communication to all food suppliers.\nThen Saruman put in an offer for the control of Isengard and both King\nFréaláf and Steward Beren embraced the proposition with open arms. Thus,\nthe wizard was handed the keys to Orthanc.\n\n\n\nAfter gaining the control of Isengard, Saruman became greatly interested\nin the Rings of Power and began to especially desire the One. He thought\nthat if he gave time for Sauron to regain some strength, the ring would\nreveal itself to him. Therefore, as head of the White Council, Saruman\noverruled Gandalf's call for an attack on Dol Guldur, the Dark Lord's\nthen current fortress. However in TA 2941, he did agree on the attack\nwhen he found out that the servants of Sauron were searching for the\nring near the Gladden Fields.\n\n\n\nLater, Saruman's mind was corrupted and fell under the control of Sauron\nwhen he used the Stone of Orthanc—the seventh Palantiri—for the first\ntime.\n\nIn TA 3018, Gandalf rode to Isengard to meet with Saruman. It was then\nthat the wizard declared his true thoughts regarding his desire to be\nruler of Men, to possess the Ring, and to join Sauron in his evil deeds.\nGandalf refused Saruman's offer to join him and Sauron. Subsequently,\nthe wizard held Gandalf captive on Orthanc's pinnacle until he submitted\nin telling the location of the One Ring. After many weeks of\nimprisonment, Gwaihir, the Lord of the Eagles, came unlooked for and\nbore him away.\n\nOnly months later, the Ents of Fangorn Forest launched their attack on\nIsengard. By the next day, only the tower of Orthanc remained, as it was\nhewn of one piece of impenetrable rock, and the plains below had been\ncompletely destroyed, leaving a desolate land of water and mud. Three\ndays after the battle, Theoden, Éomer, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and\nGimli approached Orthanc past a desolation of wreckage caused by the\nEnts including a huge blood-ridden white hand, and climbed its stair.\nThey parleyed with Saruman, who remained inside the tower and spoke to\nthem from a balcony above the door. After Saruman refused to cooperate\nand attempted to control the Rohirrim riding with them, Gandalf cast him\nfrom the Order of Wizards and the White Council, breaking Saruman's\nStaff. After the confrontation, Grima Wormtongue—who was inside the\ntower at the time—threw the Stone of Orthanc at the party outside as a\nparting shot.\n\nFourth Age\n\n\n\nOne of King Elessar's first tasks he had set was the restoration of\nOrthanc. He ordered that the Palantir should be recovered and returned\nto the tower. Then Orthanc was searched and many secrets were revealed.\nIt was clear that Saruman had been hoarding many ancient treasures and\nheirlooms during his time there. With the aid of Wormtongue, Saruman had\nacquired many jewels and heirlooms belonging to Eorl. Soon a hidden door\nwas found and inside a casket they found two precious objects: one of\nwhich was a small gold case attached to a chain - this was used by\nIsildur to bear the One Ring; and second of which was the Elendilmir -\nthe 'white star of Elvish crystal upon a fillet of mithril' that had\nbeen lost since Isildur's demise. Elessar received the Elendilmir with\nreverence and took it with him as he established his full kingship of\nArnor. It was revealed that Saruman had found the remains of Isildur and\nhad burned them.\n\nOrthanc and the plains of Isengard around it remained part of the\nReunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor. However, King Elessar granted the\nEnts complete self-governance of the area surrounding the tower. This\nnew forest became known as the Treegarth of Orthanc.\n\n\nPinnacle of Orthanc\n\n\n\nThe Pinnacle of Orthanc was the summit of Saruman's tower. Its corners\nwere razor-edged points with room for at least two men to stand. It was\naccessed by a flight of thousands of stairs, which Saruman would use to\nreach the top and observe the stars.\n\nIt was here where Saruman imprisoned Gandalf at the start of the War of\nthe Ring, which caused him to be delayed in meeting with Frodo. He was\nrescued by the Great Eagle Gwaihir, sent by Radagast the Brown.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nAccording to Tolkien, its name is both Sindarin for “Mount Fang”, and\nRohirric for “Cunning Mind”. The latter is more likely to be its real\nmeaning, as the word _Orthanc_ is a real Old English word (Old English\nbeing the linguistic basis for Rohirric); the Sindarin name being no\nmore than a poetic coincidence. In Old English, Orþanc means “cunning\ndevice”, but Tolkien has said this is merely a coincidence.",

    "text": "The KINGDOM OF RHOVANION was a realm of Men in the Middle-earth region\nof Rhovanion that is rarely given specifications in Tolkien's books.\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe kingdom of Rhovanion was founded by the northmen and stretched from\nMirkwood, in the west, to Dorwinion, in the east. It had strong ties\nwith the kingdom of Gondor and fought side by side in its wars against\nthe Easterlings of Rhûn.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the early Third Age, a group of Northmen who were led by a 'Prince of\nRhovanion' who founded the Kingdom of Rhovanion sometime before the year\nTA 490. Rhovanion at this time referred only to the region where he and\nhis people dwelt, a strip of land east of Greenwood the Great and south\nof Dale and Lake-town. It is possible that Dale and Lake-town formed\npart of the Kingdom before the Dwarven Kingdom in the Lonely Mountain\nwas founded by the Dwarves of Durin's Folk.\n\nThe Men of Rhovanion fought with Gondor against the Easterlings of Rhûn,\nwho threatened their lands, and when these were defeated by King\nTurambar of Gondor in TA 550, Rhovanion became an ally of Gondor. By TA\n1200 the ruler of Rhovanion called himself the King of Rhovanion. In TA\n1248 Rómendacil II of Gondor destroyed all camps of the Easterlings even\nbeyond the Sea of Rhûn, and a strong alliance with Rhovanion was forged.\nGondor withdrew its borders to the Anduin, and ceded all the lands east\nof Anduin to Rhovanion. From this time onward, the name Rhovanion\nreferred to all of Wilderland.\n\nThe King of Rhovanion at this time was Vidugavia, and Prince Valacar of\nGondor served in his army. Vidugavia's daughter Vidumavi married\nValacar, and their son Vinitharya became King Eldacar of Gondor in TA\n1432, which led to the Kin-strife in TA 1437. Eldacar fled to Rhovanion,\nand with a Rhovanion army, he reclaimed his Kingdom in TA 1447.\n\nIn TA 1636 the Great Plague devastated Rhovanion, killing more than half\nits people. This left Rhovanion weakened, and in TA 1851 the Wainriders\noverran and enslaved Rhovanion. For 43 years Rhovanion was enslaved, but\nin TA 1899 Rhovanion rebelled, while Gondor attacked the Wainriders from\nthe west. Rhovanion was freed, but left extremely weakened. Many Men of\nRhovanion left for Gondor, where they were welcomed as distant\nrelatives. Some of them may have gone north to Dale and Lake-town after\nTA 1999, when the Kingdom under the Mountain was founded.\n\nIn TA 2460 Sauron returned to Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood, although\nthis was not learned until long after. The land gradually became more\ndangerous, and Rhovanion was emptied of most its people. Around TA 2510\na new group of Easterlings, the Balchoth, appeared, and they quickly\ntook the old lands of Rhovanion. This was the final end of the Kingdom\nof Rhovanion after over two thousand years of independence.",

Minhiriath had no clear\nborder in the north, but to the south, and east and west it was bounded\nby river and sea: the Brandywine, the Greyflood and the Belegaer, 'The\nGreat Sea'.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe original inhabitants of Minhiriath (Minhiriathrim) were descended\nfrom the same Men as the ancestors of the Númenóreans, but because they\nspoke mutually unintelligible languages, the Númenóreans did not class\nthe Minhiriathrim as Middle Men.\n\nWhen the large-scale deforestation of their land began under the\nNúmenórean 'Ship Kings' after the 7th century Second Age, the\nMinhiriathrim became openly hostile, and were persecuted. Only those who\n“fled from Minhiriath into the dark woods of the great Cape of Eryn\nVorn” survived. Most, if not all of these forest-dwellers subsequently\n“welcomed Sauron and hoped for his victory over the Men of the Sea”, but\nthey were to be disappointed - and permanently trapped - by Sauron's\nburning of much of the rest of the surviving forest, and final defeat,\nin SA 1701.\n\nFrom SA 3320, Minhiriath became nominally part of the newly established\nKingdom of Arnor, at which time it formed the upper part of _..a land\nthat was far and wide, on either bank a desert, treeless but untilled._\n\n('The History of Galadriel and Celeborn' from Unfinished Tales)\n\nFrom TA 861, Minhiriath was inherited by one of Arnor's three successor\nstates, Cardolan, but the “ravaging” of Cardolan by the evil forces of\nthe Witch-king of Angmar in TA 1409 no doubt caused extensive\ndepopulation of the whole country. Even worse was the advent of the\nGreat Plague in TA 1636, after which Minhiriath was “almost entirely\ndeserted”. After TA 1975, even though “a few secretive hunter-folk lived\nin the woods” throughout the Third Age (probably a reference which\nincludes Eryn Vorn), Minhiriath was claimed by no kingdom at all.\n\nAlthough “still in places well-wooded” by the time of the War of the\nRing, the once continuously forested Minhiriath bore the permanent scars\nof over 5000 years of felling, burning, and war.\n\nThe same is not necessarily the case for its human population, however,\nwhen talking of Eriador (and particularly the lands south and west of\nBree) to an innkeeper at the end of the War of the Ring. For example,\nGandalf confidently predicts that _..the waste in time will be waste no\nlonger, and there will be people and fields where once there was\nwilderness._\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Minhiriath_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Between Rivers' and thus an\nElvish form of _Mesopotamia_).",

    "text": "THANGORODRIM was a group of three gigantic active volcanoes within the\nIron Mountains in the north of Middle-earth during the First Age. They\nwere raised by Morgoth, who delved his fortress of Angband beneath them\nand far back into the Iron Mountains. They were the highest peaks in all\nof Middle Earth.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThangorodrim was made up of three volcanoes of which were said to have\nbeen crafted by Morgoth from the slag and debris of the re-delving of\nAngband during the First Age. The mountains themselves were of little\nconsequence during Morgoth's rule of Angband, save to occasionally spew\nforth fire and magma when Morgoth was either exceptionally wrathful or\non the warpath.\n\nAfter the death of his father, Maedhros was taken prisoner and nailed to\na cliff of Thangorodrim as a method of torture. He was rescued by his\ncousin Fingon with the help of Thorondor, King of the Eagles. After\nhis family was cursed by Morgoth, Húrin was imprisoned in a chair on a\nhigh terrace to watch the curse unfold.\n\nFor a time immediately after the creation of Thangorodrim, the Great\nEagles made their eyries on the three mountains at the command of\nManwë in order to bring him news of Morgoth's doings. However, at some\ntime during the First Age the Eagles moved to the Crissaegrim near\nGondolin.\n\nAt the base of the south face of the middle peak was the Great Gate of\nAngband, a deep canyon leading into the mountain, lined with towers and\nforts. There were also a number of secret gates scattered around the\nsides of the mountain group, from which Morgoth's hosts could issue\nforth and surprise their foes.\n\nThangorodrim was destroyed during the War of Wrath at the end of the\nFirst Age when Ancalagon, freshly slain by Eärendil fell dead on the\npeaks and crushed them to rubble.\n\n\nSize and Height\n\nThe exact size and height of Thangorodrim are unclear, though they were\nsaid to have been the tallest mountains in Middle-earth. One drawing by\nTolkien illustrated in Karen Wynn Fonstad's _The Atlas of Middle-earth_,\nif drawn to scale, would have made each mountain 35,000 ft high and five\nmiles across, and the statement that it lay 150 leagues (450 Númenórean\nmiles) north of Menegroth puts it too far away for some of the action in\n_The Silmarillion_ to make sense; a distance of 150-200 miles would have\nbeen more consistent. It is possible that with the higher figure Tolkien\nwas not referring to 'as the eagle flies', but rather 'as the wolf\nruns': the plateau of Dorthonion forced a long detour, which added the\nextra 200, 250 miles to the distance.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_THANGORODRIM_ was a Sindarin word that tied together the roots\n'oppression', 'mountain', and 'group'; together meaning roughly\n'Oppressive peaks'.",

It was an\neastern bay of the Inland Sea of Helcar, formed by the meltwaters of the\npillar of Illuin.\n\nAfter the First Age and the War of Wrath, the Sea of Helcar (and\nCuiviénen with it) was drained, leaving behind only the Sea of Núrnen\nand the Sea of Rhûn, prompting the Elvish adage “and to Cuiviénen there\nis no returning”; both a reference to physical geography and a metaphor\nfor the Sundering. While never confirmed, there is a small chance that\nit survives in a much truncated form.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn YT 1050, the Awakening of the Elves took place. The Elves dwelt\nhere for a long time in bliss under the starlight and were content.\nHere the elves were divided into their three basic groups: the Minyar\n(Vanyar), Tatyar (Ñoldor), and Nelyar (Teleri), here they learned and\ndeveloped the basic skills of survival, culture, and language.\n\nUnfortunately, Melkor discovered this land first before the other Valar.\nMany elves feared him and they were forced to hide, and those\nunfortunate enough to be left behind or overwhelmed by fear and\nunhappiness were taken or slain. Then, years later, Oromë discovered\nCuiviénen on his travels throughout Middle-earth. Oromé reported his\ndiscovery back to the Valar in Valinor and after some debate they\ndecided that the Elves would be safer living in The Undying Lands, in\nthe peace and protection of the Valar. Oromé returned to Cuiviénen and\nthere spoke with the Elves regarding their removal to Valinor. The first\nSundering of the Elves then took place when the Eldar, name that was\ngiven by Oromé to the Elves using their own tongue, departed from\nCuiviénen to Valinor. Some of these Elves refused to leave through fear\nof the unknown, turned back after reaching the huge range of The Misty\nMountains, or simply decided to stay in Arda through choice.\n\nIt is unknown how long the remaining Avari remained at Cuiviénen during\nthe First Age, but they were there when Men awoke at the first rising of\nthe Sun in the nearby land of Hildórien, and its elven residents\nbefriended early Men and apparently taught them the basic skills of\nsurvival.\n\nOther mentions\n\nIn his attempt to sway the Ñoldor to join him in pursuit of Melkor to\nMiddle-earth, Fëanor spoke of the “sweet waters” of Cuiviénen that they\nhad left in vain to travel to Aman.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nCUIVIÉNEN is a Quenya word that means “Water of Awakening” from\n_cuivié_ (“awakening”) and _nen_ (“water”).",

    "text": "TOL ERESSËA, known also as the LONELY ISLE, was a large island located\noff the eastern coast of Aman.\n\n\nHistory\n\nTol Eressëa was originally an island that stood in the middle of the\nBelegaer far from either the coasts of Aman or Middle-earth. Ulmo\nuprooted it and with the help of his servants used it as a ferry to\ntransport the willing three kindreds of the Elves back and forth twice\nfrom Middle-earth to Aman. After that, the host of Olwë remembering the\nstar-light of their home in eastern Middle-earth begged to the Maia Ossë\nto stay their journey. Their request was granted at the behest of Ulmo.\nOssë rooted it permanently to the bottom of the sea, and never moved\nagain afterwards. The isle came to rest forever just off the eastern\nshore of Aman in the Bay of Eldamar, and the Teleri dwelt there ever\nafter. This long separation from the Vanyar and the Ñoldor caused the\nTelerin language to sunder from Quenya of the other Calaquendi. So that\nthe Teleri could see the light of Valinor, the Valar opened a cleft in\nthe Pelori so that the light of the Two Trees shone upon it, making its\nwestern shores green and fertile. Many Teleri lived here until their\nlord Olwë built the city Alqualondë on the northwestern shore of\nAman.\n\n\n\nWith the end of the First Age, many of the Eldar of Middle-earth exiles\ncame to it, and lived on the island of Tol Eressëa. Sometime during the\nearly Second Age, the Elves that chose to settle there built Avallonë in\nthe eastern part of the island. It was also where most of the elves\nvisiting Númenór came from at least until the shadow fell upon the\nNúmenóreans. The Númenóreans yearning for the light of the east would\noften gaze at the great tower of Avallonë, which they could see from the\nwesternmost parts of their homeland. When Ar-Pharazôn the Golden broke\nthe Ban of the Valar and sailed to the Undying Lands with his Great\nArmament, Tol Eressëa was surrounded by its fleets before going to\nTirion, but it is not known whether its people were assailed by this act\nor not.\n\n\nEarlier versions of the legendarium\n\nIn early versions of Tolkien's legendarium, the island was later visited\nby Ælfwine (or Eriol), an Englishman from the Middle Ages, which\nprovided a framework for the tales that later became _The Silmarillion_.\nOver time it had become a land of many beautiful places and interesting\nsites such as: Alalminórë, the Land of Elms, and Tavrobel. Along with\nUlmo, his great whale Uin was also in charge to carry the island to the\nBay of Eldamar.\n\nThe Cottage of Lost Play, which Eriol visited, was one of the more\nfamous spots in Tol Eressëa at which many stories were told (the stories\nthat became the _Lost Tales_) of ancient times.\n\nAt different eras of development of his mythology Tolkien either saw Tol\nEressëa as the island of Britain, or as the island of Avallon, off the\ncoast of Britain beyond the Straight Path near Valinor In some of the\nlater writings and letters he began to see the Shire and Rivendell to be\ncloser to England geographically. Some of the ideas of Avalon (and\nArthurian legend) that had been associated with the island can also be\nseen in the name of the city Avallonë. Tolkien even echoed this in a\nletter when he stated he had given Frodo and Bilbo an “Arthurian\nending”.\n\n    But when Morgoth was thrust forth, the Gods held council. The Elves\n    were summoned to return into the West, and such as obeyed dwelt\n    again in Eressëa, the Lonely Island, which was renamed Avallon: for\n    it is hard by Valinor.\n\n\nNotable dwellings\n\n-   Avallonë\n-   Cottage of Lost Play\n-   House of the Hundred Chimneys\n-   Kortirion",

There was only one road in\nthis region connecting any of the settlements and that was the Stock\nRoad, which ran about ten miles from Tuckborough to Woodhall.\n\n\nInhabitants and History\n\nThe region seemed to be the traditional land of the Tooks who settled\nthere when the majority of the hobbits came to the Shire after it was\ngranted for them to live in by the King of Arthedain in TA 1601 (SR 1).\nOver many the many hundreds of years, other hobbit peoples settled there\nbut the Tooks still remained in the majority.\n\nFrodo and Company passed through this land when they were on the Quest\nof the Ring and later during the Scouring of the Shire, a hundred Tooks\nled by Pippin marched from Tuckborough and the rest of this land to\nfight against the Ruffians."

This stone hill was the foundation for the\ncity Gondolin built by Turgon. Tumladen and the city it contained\nremained secret and safe for 503 years since the Return of the Ñoldor to\nMiddle-earth. It was, however, betrayed by the father of Túrin Turambar,\nHúrin Thalion, when Húrin shouted at the mountains encircling the city\nto let Turgon know to open the gates and let him in (this was an\nill-fated attempt, for no one heard him, and Húrin despaired). As Húrin\nwas under the spell of Morgoth, the Dark Lord finally learned of\nGondolin's location through Húrin. In this way, Húrin doomed the city.\nMorgoth waited for a couple more years before he finally invaded the\ncity, with the help of the traitor Maeglin, who showed him where the\nvale could be found exactly and how it could be attacked (since Great\nEagles guarded its borders). Through his treachery, Maeglin help to lie\nwaste the fair vale of Tumladen and the city that sat on Amon Gwareth in\nthe center of the vale, Gondolin.\n\n\nDescription\n\nTumladen was described by J.R.R. Tolkien as a “...green jewel among the\nencircling hills...” and as a “...green plain among the mountains.” He\nalso describes it as being very fair with the black and smooth Amon\nGwareth in the center of the vale.\n\n\nHistory\n\nTumladen was a great lake in the ancient days of Beleriand. It was\nlocated east of the upper waters of Sirion, as was found out later by\nthe Elves, in the middle of the Encircling Mountains. Turgon was shown\nby Ulmo, a Vala, where it was located by means of a dark tunnel that ran\ndeep under the mountains, hollowed out by streams that ran to join the\nSirion. In this way, Turgon discovered the vale of Tumladen, and thought\nit indeed to be a perfect place to construct his city that was supposed\nto be modeled after the great city of Tirion upon the green hill Tuna,\nback in Valinor. Indeed, after many years of labor, Gondolin did come to\nrival Tirion with its beauty and splendor. As mentioned above, Tumladen\nand the city it held, Gondolin, survived for more than 503 years, the\nlongest lasting of the Ñoldorin kingdoms. The vale was betrayed, as\nmentioned above, by Maeglin and in so doing, Maeglin finally destroyed\nthe last kingdom of the Ñoldor in Beleriand. It was there that the\nbattle of Ecthelion of the Fountain and Gothmog, the Lord of Balrogs,\ntook place in the very square of the King. There it was also that they\nslew each other, and in so doing, Ecthelion had felled the mightiest of\nBalrogs, even though he himself had died also. And so, with the\ntreachery of Maeglin, the fair vale of Tumladen and the city upon Amon\nGwareth, Gondolin, the last kingdom of the Ñoldor, were destroyed and\nruined.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Tumladen_ is a name coming from two Sindarin roots. One of the roots is\n_tum_ (pronounced _toom_), which means a valley. The other Sindarin root\nis _lad_, which means a plain or a valley. Both parts of this name\ndoubly imply and tell that Tumladen is a plain/valley, a very\ninteresting combination of Sindarin roots on the part of Tolkien.\n\n\nOther\n\nIn the Third Age, Tumladen was a valley near the southeastern end of the\nWhite Mountains. When Pippin arrived in Minas Tirith, he saw vehicles\ncarrying the old, the children and the women to take refuge in Lebennin\nthrough the vales Tumladen, Lossarnach, and the mountain-villages.\nTumladen was placed at the source of River Sirith in _The Atlas of\nMiddle-earth_."

Beren Camlost son of Barahir crosses the Talath Dirnen\nafter departing from Menegroth to begin his Quest for a Silmaril.\nSeeking the aid of Felagund, and knowing the skill of the rangers, Beren\nholds ever aloft the Ring of Barahir and is eventually waylaid and taken\nby Felagund's soldiers to Nargothrond. Years later, a bridge is built\nacross Narog from Talath Dirnen to Nargothrond at the order of Túrin\nTurambar. This helps lead to the sack of Nargothrond at the hands of\nGlaurung the Dragon and Morgoth's forces. After the sack, Niënor Níniel\nencounters Glaurung near Amon Ethir and falls under his spell,\nfurthering the curse laid upon the Children of Húrin by Morgoth.\n\nIt was sunk along with the most of Beleriand at the end of the War of\nWrath.\n"

It was close to the Great Goblin's cavern by following an\nestimated thirty miles of long, dark, and narrow tunnel.\n\nThe cave housed a small subterranean lake of ice cold water in which sat\na tiny island which supplied Gollum with a small amount of protection\nfrom the nearby Goblin Camp. This lake harboured a species of blind\nfish, Gollum's main food source throughout the years he spent there.\n\n\nGollum's history there\n\nAfter being exiled from his family of Stoors in the late twenty-third\ncentury of the Third Age, Gollum sought shelter from the Sun under the\nnearby mountain range, the Misty Mountains. Following the flow of an\nunderground stream, he made his way to a dark cave and made his home\nthere.  He soon found out that Goblins were living close by and used the\nnetwork of tunnels adjoining his. When he felt bold and hungry enough,\nGollum, using his magic ring to become invisible, throttled them and ate\nthem.\n\nIn TA 2941, Bilbo Baggins and his company of Dwarves were journeying\nthrough the Misty Mountains and were taken by surprise as a group of\ngoblins jumped upon them, causing a great mass of confusion amongst the\nDwarves. During their escape from Goblin-town, Bilbo would then have to\nfend for himself after falling and being missed in the darkness. He soon\nstumbled upon this cave after finding the One Ring and subsequently met\nGollum. Gollum, afraid of Bilbo's Elvish dagger, didn't attack as he\nnormally would have done. Instead, he spoke to Bilbo and ended up taking\npart in a game of riddles with the hobbit. If Gollum won, he would kill\nand eat Bilbo, and if Bilbo won, Gollum would show him the way out.\nAfter Gollum lost the riddle-game and discovered the loss of the Ring,\nhe became enraged and tried to kill Bilbo. However, Bilbo put on the\nRing and used it to follow Gollum to the exit of the cave.\n\nAfter Bilbo's escape with the Ring, Gollum remained in the cave for a\nlong time. However, he eventually left and wandered Middle-earth, trying\nto find Bilbo and reclaim his One Ring for himself once again."

The Great West Road was approximately 425 miles long.\n\nAt its far eastern end, the Great West Road met the North-way which came\nfrom Minas Tirith through Forannest, the North-gate of the Rammas Echor.\nThe Great West Road then curved around Amon Dîn and ran westward through\nAnorien. The Road skirted the edge of the Drúadan Forest and passed the\nBeacon-hills of Gondor at the foot of the White Mountains.\n\nThe Great West Road ran through the edge of the Firien wood to avoid the\nmarshy land north of the forest. A path marked by a standing stone\nbranched southward off the Road to Halifirien, the last of the\nBeacon-hills. At the western edge of the Firien Wood, the Great West\nRoad crossed a bridge over the Mering Stream, which was the border\nbetween Gondor and Rohan.\n\nIn Rohan, the Great West Road passed through the Fenmarch and the\nregions of the Eastfold and the Folde. The Road traversed the Snowbourn\nby way of a ford near Edoras, and a track branched off to the city.\nFurther on, the Deeping-road branched off into the Deeping Coomb where\nHelm's Deep was located.\n\nThe Great West Road then curved northwestward for a ways. About two\nmiles before the Fords of Isen there was a sharp westward turn and the\nRoad ran straight down to the riverbank. On the other side of the Isen,\nthe North-South Road began. A branch road led north to Isengard.\n\nIn the early days of Gondor, the Great West Road and the North-South\nRoad formed a single Royal Road between the two Kingdoms of the\nDunedain. At that time, the region between the Mering Stream and the\nFords of Isen was a province of Gondor called Calenardhon. In TA 2510,\nthat land became Rohan and the Rohirrim were responsible for maintaining\nthe stretch of the Great West Road that ran through their land.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, an army from Mordor crossed the Anduin into\nAnorien and blocked the Great West Road.

Presumably, it was a very\nlarge place in portion as Morgoth was quite large himself. It was a\nplace of utmost fear and horror with brightly lit fires,\nhorrible-looking pillars that towered like trees boughs like serpents,\nand was filled with weapons and instruments of death and torture. Across\nthe hall stood a monstrous column and beneath it was the throne of\nMorgoth.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Nethermost Hall was possibly delved and raised when Angband was\nbuilt or when Morgoth returned there from Aman after stealing the\nSilmarils. As he rarely left Angband, Morgoth probably spent most of his\ntime here plotting his evils, torturing, and interrogating helpless\nprisoners. The Nethermost Hall was best known for being the place where\nBeren and Lúthien confronted Morgoth when he lost one of the Silmarils\nto Beren."

    "text": "The NORTH-SOUTH ROAD was part of the Royal Road linking Arnor and\nGondor. The North-South Road was approximately 600 miles long. It ran\nbetween Fornost in the north and Isengard in the south. At the Fords of\nIsen, the North-South Road merged with the Great West Road.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe northern half of the North-South Road was in Eriador. From Fornost,\nthe Road ran south to Bree. Outside the West-gate of Bree, the\nNorth-South Road intersected with the Great East Road. At this major\ncrossroads was the inn called The Prancing Pony, where travellers\nbrought news from the South as well as goods such as Pipe-weed, which\nfirst came to Bree and the Shire via the North-South Road.\n\nThe North-South Road then moved on through the narrow passage called the\nAndrath between the Barrow-downs and the South Downs. South of the\nAndrath, a road to the Shire branched off the North-South Road. The\nNorth-South Road then curved southeastward through the region of\nMinhiriath.\n\nAt the city of Tharbad, the Road crossed the River Greyflood on the\nsouthern border of Eriador. Originally, the Road went over the Bridge of\nTharbad. On either side of the Bridge, the Road was built up on\ncauseways to traverse the surrounding marshland. However, the Bridge was\ndestroyed by floods in TA 2912 and all that remained was a dangerous\nford.\n\nThe southern half of the North-South Road passed through Enedwaith,\nwhich at one time nominally belonged to Gondor but was essentially a\nborderland between Gondor and Arnor. East of the Road in Enedwaith was\nDunland at the foot of the Misty Mountains.\n\nAt the southern end of the Misty Mountains, the North-South Road curved\neastward through the Gap of Rohan and ended at the Fords of Isen. Just\nwest of the Fords a road branched north to Isengard. East of the Fords\nwas the Great West Road to Minas Tirith and Osgiliath.\n\nTogether the North-South Road and the Great West Road formed the Royal\nRoad, or Great Road, which was the main route by land between Gondor and\nArnor. The two Kingdoms were founded in 3320 of the Second Age. Each was\nresponsible for maintaining their own stretch of the Road, and together\nthey built and maintained the Bridge of Tharbad and its causeways.\n\nAfter the Great Plague of TA 1636, Gondor and Arnor were considerably\nweakened and could no longer keep the Road and Bridge in repair. The\nNorth-kingdom fell in TA 1974 and Fornost at the northern end of the\nNorth-South Road was abandoned. The causeways near Tharbad eventually\ndisintegrated and the marshes encroached on the Road. In the spring of\nTA 2912 after the Fell Winter, floods caused the Bridge to collapse.\n\nFewer and fewer travellers used the North-South Road and it became\novergrown with grass, so that the people of Bree called it the Greenway.\nHowever, during the War of the Ring at the end of the Third Age,\nunwelcome travellers began to come up the North-South Road from the\nSouth. Some were honest refugees, but many were troublemakers, including\nagents of Saruman. Early in 3019, there was fighting in Bree, and the\nShire was taken over by Saruman's agents.\n\nThe Hobbits expelled the Men from the Shire in the Battle of Bywater on\nNovember 3, and the Rangers of the North returned from the war and dealt\nwith the other troublemakers. The North-kingdom was reestablished by\nAragorn, King Elessar, and the North-South Road was open to travellers\nonce more.\n\n\nNames & Etymology\n\nThe NORTH-SOUTH ROAD was called the GREENWAY in later years by the\nBree-folk because it had become disused and overgrown with grass. It was\nsometimes called the NORTH ROAD and the OLD SOUTH ROAD.\n\nThe North-South Road and the Great West Road were collectively called\nthe ROYAL ROAD or the GREAT ROAD. (Note that the Great East Road was\nalso referred to as the Great Road.)"

About it lay a smooth sward, shelving\ndown on all sides to its bare umbroken rim.”\n\n\nGeography\n\n\n\nThe lake lay less than a mile east and a little below the Great Gates of\nMoria. It was long and oval, shaped like a great spear-head thrust deep\ninto the northern glen of the vale. Its waters were dark: a deep blue\nlike clear evening sky and there was a smooth sward of grass around its\nrim.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the First Age, Durin the oldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves\nwandered into Azanulbizar vale and beheld in a small, still lake a\nreflection of himself bearing a crown of seven stars. The stars were the\nconstellation Durin's Crown which the elves call Valacirca and men call\nthe Big Bear. Because of this sign Durin chose to build his great hall\nMoria in the mountains above that vale. The name Kheled-zâram is in\nKhuzdul and means “Glass-lake”. In Westron it was called MIRRORMERE, it\nis probably so named because the waters of the lake were always smooth\nand the stars could always be seen reflected in its surface no matter\nthe time of day. Only Durin, however, could see his own reflection.\n\nThe Dwarves of Durin's Folk regarded this site as sacred and built a\nmonument there. It was a single stone column called Durin's Stone,\nstanding by the roadside. After Moria was abandoned it fell into\ndisrepair, and in the last years of the Third Age it was cracked,\nweather-worn, and broken at the top.\n\nWhen Balin came to retake Moria in TA 2989 one of his companions, a\ndwarf named Flói was slain in a battle before the Gates and was buried\nin a place of honour by the banks of Kheled-zâram. Balin himself was\nkilled here five years later, by an orc arrow, when he went alone to\nlook into the lake.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring stopped briefly at Kheled-zâram while Gimli,\nFrodo, and Sam took time to look into the lake, even though they were in\ngreat hurry."

The forest bordered by Dorthonion and was the\nnorthwest border of the Kingdom of Doriath, and lay between the rivers\nTeiglin (west) and Sirion (east). It was a dense, sparsely populated\nBeech forest.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBrethil was probably originally part of Doriath during most of the Years\nof the Trees. When the Girdle of Melian was set after the First Battle,\nthe Forest of Brethil was not included in it and was for the most part\nunsettled. However, King Thingol still held lordship over it.\n\nWhen Men came into the Beleriand, King Thingol gave his permission for\nsome of their peoples to settle there so long as they defended it. It\nwas to Brethil that the House of Haleth removed after dwelling east of\nthe river Gelion, settling mainly on the Hill of Amon Obel where upon\nstood Ephel Brandir, the main feature of the forest. They defended it\nfrom the Orcs until the late fifth century of the First Age, when much\nof their number was lost including their Lord Handir in a raid by the\nenemy. Some Drúedain also dwelt there.\n\nThe Haladin came to Brethil from the lands of Caranthir by way of\nEstolad. They had endured much hardship upon their long journey, but\nbegan to recover and multiply in the isolated forest. There they formed\nan alliance with Elu Thingol, King of Doriath. At need, Thingol sent\nBeleg Cúthalion with great force of his Sindarin Elves west to fight\nalongside Halmir son of Haldan, Lord of the Haladin. The combined force\ndestroyed a legion of Orcs, and the realm had peace for a time. Later,\nmany of the Woodmen of Brethil joined the muster of Húrin son of Galdor,\nclose kin of their lord Haldir, son of Halmir, and took part in the\nNirnaeth Arnoediad.\n\nAfter the disastrous battle, the Haladin became even more reclusive.\nMany withdrew to Ephel Brandir, the home of their lord Brandir the Lame,\nupon Amon Obel. Years later, Túrin Turambar son of Húrin was brought to\nEphel Brandir, and became the de facto lord of the Haladin. The tragedy\nof the Children of Hurin ensnared the Haladin, and the forest was\neventually attacked by Glaurung, father of Dragons. He burnt a path\ndirectly towards Ephel Brandir, but Túrin managed to slay him at\nCabed-en-Aras upon Teiglin with his mighty sword Gurthang. Returning\ntowards Ephel Brandir, Túrin learned the truth about his wife Níniel,\nand he, Níniel and Brandir all perished.

    "text": "The BLUE MOUNTAINS or ERED LUIN, also known as ERED LINDON, was a\nmountain range situated in the far west of Eriador.\n\n\nHistory\n\nEarly Arda\n\nThe Blue Mountains arose sometime after the tumultuous chaos caused by\nMelkor's destruction of the Two Lamps that destroyed the perfect\nsymmetry of Arda. In these early days, the Blue Mountains were located\nbetween the newly formed great sea of Belegaer and the newly formed Sea\nof Helcar. The Blue Mountains were connected to the Iron Mountains to\nthe north and the Red Mountains in the east which formed one great\nmountain range chain known by different names. The Ancient Grey\nMountains were to its south separated by a great gap.\n\nEldar Days\n\nDuring the Years of the Trees and the Sleep of Yavanna, the Blue\nMountains was an unbroken line separating Eriador from Beleriand. Seven\nrivers arose in it on the western side, and the land these rivers flowed\nthrough was known as Ossiriand, which was later also known as Lindon,\ntherefore the mountains were sometimes referred to as the Ered Lindon.\nDwarven kinfolk either awoke here or migrated here from other awakening\npoints and delved the cities of Belegost and Nogrod and made contact and\nalliance with the Sindar of Thingol.\n\nSecond Age\n\nThe mountain range was broken during the war of the Valar against\nMorgoth, and at the middle of the range the sea broke through, creating\na great gap where was set the Gulf of Lune a new terminus for the river\nLune. In the middle of the gap, where the Lune met the sea, the Grey\nHavens of Mithlond of the Elven Kingdom of Lindon were built. When seen\nas the border of Lindon the Ered Luin were called Ered Lindon.\n\n\n\nThird Age and beyond\n\nDuring the Third Age, its forests, besides that of Mirkwood, were the\nlargest in Middle-earth. In the latter part of the Third Age, the\nDwarves settled the Blue Mountains again when Thráin II and his son\nThorin and the Dwarven survivors of the Sack of Erebor moved from\nDunland and delved a prosperous settlement there. After the War of\nthe Ring and the defeat of Sauron, Elves continued to travel west to\nLindon through the gap in the mountains by way of the Gulf of Lune,\nwhere they eventually intended to set sail on the Straight Road to the\nUndying Lands of Aman. After the War of the Ring it is said that many\nDwarves from the east migrated back to their ancient homeland and Ered\nLuin was a prosperous kingdom oncemore.\n\n\nInhabitants\n\nDwarves\n\nThe Blue Mountains, the Iron Hills, and Lonely Mountain were the main\nareas of Dwarf colonization by the late Third Age. During the 4000+\nyears following the cataclysmic sundering and catastrophic downfall of\nBeleriand, when the mighty Dwarf fortress-cities of Nogrod and Belegost\nwere inundated by the sea, it is possible that the Dwarves rebuilt those\ncities to their former splendor.\n\n\n\nThe Dwarves would have plundered the mines of the Blue Mountains for the\nhoard of resources it held within the depths of darkness at its roots. \n\nBefore setting off in their quest to the Lonely Mountain, Thorin\nOakenshield and his twelve other companions (as well as other Dwarves of\nthe Lonely Mountain) resided here in the Blue Mountains after being\nrendered homeless by the Dragon Smaug.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, many Dwarves from the eastern kingdoms\nmigrated back to the Blue Mountains. Their population grew and the Blue\nMountains became a prosperous kingdom once again.\n\nElves\n\nIt is shown in several maps made of Middle-earth that vast ancient\nforests flanked both sides of the Blue Mountains, even after the\ngargantuan slaughter of Eriador's great forests by the men of Númenor\nand their incessant appetite for lumber. These forests, alongside the\nfertile coastal plain, would prove to be hotspots for Elven migration\nand inhabitation.\n\n\n\nIt is stated at the very beginning of _The Hobbit_ that the High Elves\nlived within the vales and forests of the Blue Mountains, presumably\nsharing the land with the Dwarves. To this number would be added Sindar,\nWood-elves, and maybe even a few Avari.\n\nThe influx of new Elven settlers soared after the end of the First Age\nwho lived under the Ñoldor High King Gil-galad in the Second Age.\nAfter the fall of Gil-galad in the Third Age, the foot of the Blue\nMountains became part of Lindon where Elves lived temporarily until they\nleft for the Undying Lands, due to the Elves desiring to escape the woes\nand predicaments of Middle-earth.\n\n\nGeology\n\nAlthough the Blue Mountains were little described (owing to their\nlocation on the fringes of all of Tolkien's tales), we can assume a bit\nof their geology. The outer layers of the mountains seem to have been\nunderlaid by metamorphic rocks formed in contact with numerous igneous\nintrusions. This environment is often necessary to produce veins of ore\nsuch as those mined by the Dwarves from the beginning of time. This\nenvironment produced the trove of Gold, Silver, Iron, Gems, and other\nmaterials that made the Dwarf kingdoms incredibly wealthy.\n\nThe Blue mountains were shorter than the Misty Mountains, and not as\nhigh; their altitude was probably around 3000-4000 meters, on average.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe Sindarin name for the mountains, _ERED LUIN_ is translated as the\nwords _ered_ ('Mountains') and _luin_ ('Blue'). \n",

The Paths then continued past forgotten\ncities, emerging at the southern end of the White Mountains in Morthond\nvale, near the Stone of Erech.\n\nIn the Second Age, a people related to the Dunlendings had lived in the\nWhite Mountains, and they had for a time served the Dark Lord Sauron.\nThey later swore allegiance to Isildur of Gondor and Arnor, but betrayed\nhim during the Last Alliance of Elves and Men and refused to fight on\neither side.

It was attacked and besieged many times during\nthe First Age by the forces of Morgoth. When Men came into the service\nof the Ñoldor, it was entrusted to the House of Hador. It survived the\nDagor Bragollach but was conquered and occupied by the enemy after the\nNirnaeth Arnoediad.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBarad Eithel guarded a pass over the Ered Wethrin into Hithlum, the\nrealm of Fingolfin, the High King of the Ñoldor. There were several\nmountain fortresses along the eastern border, but Barad Eithel was\nFingolfin's primary stronghold. Cavalry based at Barad Eithel patrolled\nthe plains of Ard-galen.\n\nDuring the Dagor Bragollach in FA 455, rivers of fire from Angband\nturned the grassy plain of Ard-galen into Anfauglith. The Elves of\nHithlum and their allies the Men of Dor-lómin were driven back to the\nmountain forts.\n\nDuring the Siege of Angband, Barad Eithel lay at the heart of the\nNoldor's defences, and also guarded the passes westward into Hithlum.\nThroughout the siege, Elves of Fingolfin's people would patrol the green\nfields of Ard-galen, holding Morgoth within his fortress at Angband,\nclose by to the north.\n\nThat changed in the Dagor Bragollach, when the plains of Ard-galen were\noverrun with rivers of fire and turned to scorching dust. Armies of Orcs\nassailed Fingolfin's city, but it held firm, though Hador, the Lord of\nDor-lómin and his younger son Gundor were both lost in its defence, in\nfront of the fortress's walls. Looking out across the burning desert in\ndespair, Fingolfin set out from Barad Eithel to challenge Morgoth to\nsingle combat, and was lost. His son Fingon became the High King of the\nÑoldor in his place, and took up his rule from Eithel Sirion.\n\n\n\nThough the Siege of Angband had been broken, Barad Eithel still held,\nand so the passes into Hithlum remained secure. Morgoth resolved to\nbreak this defence, and sent another army seven years after the Dagor\nBragollach to overcome Fingon's forces. Again they were repulsed, but\nGaldor was slain in the attack, where his father Hador had fallen just\nseven years before. Galdor was killed by an arrow. His son Húrin then,\ndrove the enemy forces back from Barad Eithel and pursued them across\nAnfauglith.\n\nWhen the Elves came together for a vast new assault on Morgoth, Barad\nEithel was the staging post for the western armies. It was from there\nthat the soldiers of Fingon swept across the dusty remnant of Ard-galen,\nin the glorious beginning of the battle that would turn to the tragedy\nof the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. Gelmir's brother Gwindor was on the outworks\nof Barad Eithel, and in his anger he launched a premature attack against\nMorgoth's forces. Fingon ordered his troops to follow and advance on\nAngband, but despite their initial success they were ultimately defeated\nin the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. Fingon was killed and no Elves returned to\nHithlum, which Morgoth gave to the Easterlings.\n\nThough the fate of Barad Eithel in that battle is polemical described,\nthe fact that Fingon's realm was destroyed and Hithlum occupied must\nmean that the fortress at Eithel Sirion was captured or destroyed. By\nthe last years of the First Age, if Fingolfin's mountain fortress was\nnot in the hands of the Orcs, it would have fallen into ruin and\ndecay.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _BARAD EITHEL_ means “Tower of the Well” in Sindarin from\n_barad_ meaning “tower” and _eithel_ meaning “well, spring”.",

It was there that Thingol\nwas slain by the Dwarven craftsmen of Nogrod. The quest of Beren to gain\na Silmaril begins at Menegroth. It is also here that Lúthien the fair\nwas born. It was later sacked by the Sons of Fëanor in pursuit of one of\nthe Silmarils taken from Morgoth's Iron Crown prior to the War of Wrath.\n\n\nHistory\n\nYears of the Trees\n\n\n\nIn the years after the War for Sake of the Elves, the Teleri were\nscattered all over Beleriand in havens such as Falas or in the woodlands\nat Region and Neldoreth. Their leader Elwë disappeared for a long time\nin the woods with Melian, his beloved. Then, he and Melian reappeared\ncalling himself Thingol, was urged to build a home for his people, so he\nhad the Dwarves of Belegost to aid in the construction of a new\nfortress. It was dug into the western wall of the ravine above the river\nEsgalduin and had only one entrance high above the river accessible by a\nlarge stone bridge. It was named Menegroth or the Thousand Caves because\nof the extensive number of caverns and chambers within all hewn of stone\nand beautifully decorated with carvings of beech trees and birds. These\nwere many different places including armories, treasures, smithies, and\nliving quarters for both the Elves and Dwarves.\n\nDuring the Years of the Trees, Doriath received peace for a long while\nas Thingol preferred isolation and ordered his people not to mingle in\nthe affairs of the Noldor due to the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and the\nQuenyan language was forbidden in his realm. Only with his kin in\nNargothrond did Thingol remain in contact with. He did not take part in\nany of the later Battles of Beleriand relating to the struggle with\nMorgoth.\n\nSometime during mid First Age, Beren Erchamion asked Thingol's\ndaughter, Lúthien, for her hand in marriage, but the King demanded that\nBeren was to go on a quest to retrieve a Silmaril from Morgoth's Iron\nCrown. Lúthien accompanied him on the quest to Angband and they\nsucceeded in eventually retrieving the jewel; but the stakes were high.\nCarcharoth, a wolf guarding the Gates of Angband, bit off Beren's hand\nin which he was holding the Silmaril. The wolf ventured to Menegroth,\nravaging the lands in his path, and broke through its boundaries. He was\nconfronted by the brave Huan, the Great Hound of Valinor, on the\nnorth-east banks of Esgalduin and was killed in the brawl. The Silmaril\nwas found in the wolf's stomach, after swallowing it in Beren's hand,\nand was given to King Thingol.\n\nSack of Doriath\n\nYears later, Hurin Thalion brought the famed Nauglamir as a gift to\nThingol. Thingol contemplated a plan to set the Silmaril into the\nNauglamir. He offered a reward to the Dwarven craftsmen of Nogrod if\nthey succeeded in setting the stone into the Nauglamir. A great desire\nfor the Silmaril possessed the Dwarves and they formed a greed to own\nboth the jewel and the Nauglamir. They finished the work and\nsubsequently claimed the treasure for themselves, slew Thingol, and fled\nMenegroth. \n\nThe news spread fast and the Dwarves were hunted for and then slain. Two\nescaped and and told a tale of lies about their ''betrayal ''and their\nbrethren being _slaughtered_ by the Elves._ _The Dwarves of Nogrod\nformed a great army and rose in anger at the elves and invaded the now\nunguarded Doriath._ _This led to the Battle of the Thousand Caves_ _in\nwhich many were slain on both sides. Mablung, the leader of the guard,\nwas slaughtered at the doors of the treasure chamber where the Nauglamir\nwas held. The Dwarves of Nogrod were then waylaid at Sarn Athrad on\ntheir return by the Laiquendi led by Beren.

    "text": "The BLACK GATE, or “MORANNON”, was the gate of Udûn in\nnorthwestern Mordor, and the most fortified and direct entrance into the\nland of Mordor.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nThe Black Gate was set in an impregnable black stone and iron wall that\nstretched from the Mountains of Ash in the north to the Ephel Duath in\nthe west. The wall has been estimated to be 60 feet high and 250 feet\nlong, with each half of the great gate being 90 feet wide, and set on\nlarge stone wheels. Behind the gate were gigantic circular stone\nramparts, and when the gate needed to be opened, two pairs of\nMountain-trolls who were tethered to gigantic beams pushed their way\naround their rampart's track, gradually levering open the gate and\nallowing for the incoming or outgoing of Mordor's armies.\n\nInset within the wall were myriads of archers, spearmen, bowmen, and\nhundreds of thousands of Orc troops ready to defend Mordor. The Gates\nthemselves may have been made of the same indomitable stone that\nconstitutes Orthanc, so hard that even the Ents could not dent it.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIt was originally a gate built by Sauron the Dark Lord of Mordor in the\nSecond Age, to protect and guard the northern entrance into Mordor and\nto prevent invasion at the gap between the Ash Mountains and the Ephel\nDúath. It was probably built with the help of the power of the One Ring,\nlike the Barad-dûr. After Sauron's fall after the Battle of Dagorlad, it\nbecame a garrison of the Men of Gondor. In Gondor's early days, when it\nwas building towers and cities such as Minas Ithil and Cirith Ungol\nclose to Mordor's border, it raised the two great Towers of the Teeth,\nNarchost and Carchost, which were built on either side of the wall and\nwere tall enough to overlook it.\n\nIt was backed up on the other side by the Isenmouthe, and protected by\nthe castle of Durthang to the west; it was redesigned to prevent\nanything evil from entering or leaving Mordor, shielding the outside\nfrom it - and it from the outside. The reconstruction of Minas Ithil,\nTower of the Rising Moon, as well as the construction of Cirith Ungol\nwas also done for the same purpose.\n\n\n\nHowever, they eventually failed and they were taken over by the servants\nof Sauron. Once taken by the Enemy, they became a monument of dread,\nfear, evil, and awe by anyone who saw the gate. Thus the Ringwraiths and\nOrcs re-entered Mordor, eventually overrunning the garrisons and\ninhabiting and taking them for their own uses. It was at this time that\nthe Nazgûl took the tower of Minas Ithil, having its name changed to\n_Minas Morgul_.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Frodo and Sam had a chance to go through the\nBlack Gate when they arrived at Mordor, but it was so heavily fortified\nand guarded by the forces of Mordor that they turned away and were led\non a different route into Mordor by Sméagol. They also saw an army of\nEasterlings enter the gate.\n\nThe Black Gate was the site of the last valiant battle of the War of the\nRing, in the East. In March 3019, the Army of the West commanded by\nAragorn Elessar and numbering some 6,000 men (plus one Elf, one Dwarf,\nand a Wizard and one Hobbit) arrived at the Black Gate and challenged\nthe many remaining armies of Mordor. Their intention was to draw the\nwatchful Eye of Sauron away from Mount Doom, to allow Frodo the\nRing-bearer to cast the One Ring into the Crack of Doom and destroy it.\nThe delay worked and the Ring was destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom,\nfollowing which the Black Gate and the Towers of the Teeth immediately\ncollapsed.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe Black Gate's literal Sindarin translation, _Morannon_, means “Black\nGate” from _môr_ (“dark, black”) and _annon_ (“gate, door”).",

The\nDead Marshes were part of the ancient battlefield of the Battle of\nDagorlad between the Last Alliance and the forces of Mordor, where many\nof the fallen were laid to rest. Over time, the battlefield became\nmarshes, which swallowed up the dead, though their bodies could still be\nseen floating in the water (although, according to Gollum, they are not\nphysically there, and only appear as visions).\n\nDuring Gondor's war with the Wainriders, King Ondoher's army was caught\nby surprise and he and his men were driven into the Dead Marshes and\ndefeated. When Eärnil II became king, he avenged the earlier defeat at\nthe Battle of the Camp in TA 1944, and the Wainriders were defeated and\ndriven into the marshes where most perished.\n\nThe Dead Marshes were located north-west of the Morannon, and southeast\nof the Emyn Muil. Aragorn once captured Gollum here, on February 1, 3017\nand took him to Mirkwood.\n\nThe War of the Ring\n\n\n\nDuring the quest to destroy the One Ring, Gollum led Frodo Baggins and\nSamwise Gamgee on a passage through the marshes. They entered the Dead\nMarshes at Dawn on the 1st of March. The Passage was marked by lights\nthat danced about and candles which Gollum called “_candles of\ncorpses_”; it is likely that those who become entranced by these lights\nand attempt to touch the bodies drown in the water and go down to join\nthe dead. It seems that the bodies only appear in the water when the\nlights are lit. At the Mere of Dead Faces, Frodo became entranced by\nthese lights and tried to reach out and touch the faces of the dead at\nthe bottom of the marshes, though Sam broke him out of his trance.\nGollum told them that the dead could not be touched, suggesting that he\nhad once tried to eat them. While passing through the marshes, a Black\nRider on a Fell beast passed overhead, terrifying Gollum enough that he\nstarted to slip back into his old speech-habits, which he had somewhat\ngiven up after swearing to “serve the master of the Precious.” They\nexited the Marshes on the morning of March 2, 3019.\n\n\n",

The camps on Balar maintained close contact with the refugee\ncamp in Arvernien headed by the half-elf, Eärendil.

On the western border, a long stone road\noutside the Deep Fosse ran for many dozens of miles also surrounded the\ncity. The only entrance was in the south through a set of Great Gates\nacross a bridge in the Deep Fosse.\n\n\n\nThe city was a host of Mallorn trees where the elves lived in flets a\ntop the trees. Located in the city's center, atop the largest Mallorn in\nthe city, was the flet of Celeborn and Galadriel and the Chamber of\nCeleborn.\n\nOther notable features were Galadriel’s garden and her mirror both in\nthe southeast quarter.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe building of the city was probably started by the Silvan-speaking\nNandor elves who first settled the forest area of Lórien during the Time\nof the Trees under the light of stars, and was no doubt completed and/or\nadded to throughout the ages by the city's later Sindarin lords. No\ndoubt beautiful during the days of Amdír and his son Amroth, it was\ntheir successors' Celeborn and his wife Galadriel that made the city\ninto a blissful but rather isolated Elven haven.\n\n\n\nDuring the events of the War of the Ring, the Fellowship of the Ring was\nbrought through Lórien to Caras Galadhon, and there met the lords of the\nGaladhrim. Around the time of the siege of Minas Tirith Lorien was\nbesieged itself by Dol Guldur, three times.\n\nDuring the Fourth Age, after Galadriel had left Lórien, Caras Galadhon\nwas ruled by a lonely Celeborn as capital of a Lórien which now spanned\nboth sides of the river Anduin, but at some point during the age he left\nfor Valinor as well, and Caras Galadhon slowly became depopulated. It is\nunclear just how this came about since most of Lórien's people were\nSilvan Elves and, presumably, not necessarily inclined to leave\nMiddle-earth so soon after Sauron's fall; there are different references\nto the Fate of the Elves of Middle-earth scattered throughout Tolkien's\npublished works. Caras Galadhon is called a “great city” in the Lord of\nthe Rings, and the impression is that its population numbered in the\nthousands. However, the “Tale of Aragorn and Arwen” in Appendix A\ndepicts Caras Galadhon as wholly abandoned by the time of Aragorn II\nElessar's death.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _CARAS GALADHON_ means “Fortress of Trees”: from the Silvan\n_caras_ (“fortress”) and _galadhon_ (“of trees”). It may also be\ntranslated as “Fortress of Galadhon”. _Galadhon_ may be referred to\nCeleborn's father, Galadhon.

Since the region was originally heavily forested but\nbecame bleak and treeless after Sauron ravaged it, a similarity may be\ndrawn between the Wold of Rohan and the Weald of Southeastern England.\nThis region was once covered by woodland; over centuries, however, local\nindustry, especially iron production, led to deforestation. The\netymological relation, as well as the historical similarity (especially\nwhen considering Sauron's fondness of destructive industrialization and\nTolkien's personal dislike of such), indicate that the name Wold is\nlikely an intentional play on words on Tolkien's part, similar perhaps\nto possibly intentional use of Atalantë (Atlantis) for Numenor.",

According to the _The Atlas of\nMiddle-earth_, it extended some 4,000 feet into the mountain.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the War of the Ring\n\nGlittering Caves was one of the two fortresses built by Númenóreans to\nguard the Fords of Isen, Angrenost (later Isengard) being the other.\nLike Angrenost to the north it was initially well - guarded, but as the\npopulation of Calenardhon (the later Rohan) dwindled it was increasingly\nless supplied and deemed unimportant, until it was only ruled by a\nhereditary small guard who intermarried much with Dunlendings.\n\nWhen Cirion, Steward of Gondor, gave Calenardhon to the Éothéod, the\nGlittering Caves was transferred to the Rohirrim who used it for refuge\nduring war, strife, and the storage of provisions, but guard duty of the\nFords was initially shared between Gondor and Rohan. The fortress then\nunderwent repair with help from the masons of Gondor. The Gondor guard\nwas merged with that of Angrenost to the north, which remained in the\nkeep of Gondor. The shared garrisoning of the fortress continued for a\ntime until soon it was solely part of Rohan and maintained only by the\nRohirrim.\n\nDuring the reign of Helm Hammerhand, the Dunlendings attacked from\nIsengard and across the river Isen conquering parts of Rohan. Edoras was\noverran and sacked, and King Helm was forced to lead much of his people\ninto the caves where they remained during the Long Winter of TA 2758 and\nTA 2759. Because Helm always blew a great horn before riding out to\nfight the beleaguering Dunlendings, the keep was renamed HORNBURG.\n\nWar of the Ring and afterwards\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, the Hornburg was the refuge of the Rohirrim\nduring the Battle of the Hornburg after being driven back by the Host of\nSaruman. After the war, Gimli the Dwarf, who had fought mightily in\nthat battle, was allowed to settle a colony of Durin's folk there,\nleading a host of Dwarves from the Lonely Mountain and became the first\nLord of the Glittering Caves. From this stronghold, after it had been\ncarefully constructed, Gimli forged a new gate for Minas Tirith made of\nMithril and Steel. Gimli and Legolas made a pact of friendship, that\nwhen the wars of their age ended, that Gimli should walk in the deep\nwoods of Fangorn and that Legolas should behold the jeweled-splendour of\nthe Glittering Caves. The Glittering Caves lay in front of a huge and\nvery beautiful cave system which proved irresistible to him. Gimli\nbecame known as the 'Lord of the Glittering Caves', although this new\nrealm was presumably under the overlordship of Thorin Stonehelm, his\nkinsman and heir of the lordship of all Durin's Folk. The Dwarves of\nGlittering Caves restored the Hornburg following the War of the Ring,\nand it became a shared fortress between them and the Rohirrim.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Sindarin, it is called AGLAROND, which means “Caves of Glory” or\n“Caves of Light”. It comes from the words _aglar_ (“glory, light”) and\n_rond_ (“cave”). It is called GLÆMSCRAFU, the “Caves of Rodiance”,\nin Rohirric,which in actuality was an Anglo-Saxon word.\n",

    "text": "_'Lake-town, OR Esgaroth_', known fully as “ESGAROTH UPON THE LONG\nLAKE”, was a small settlement and community of Men in the north-western\npart of the Long Lake in the Rhovanion. The town was constructed\nentirely of wood and stands upon wooden pillars sunk into the bed of the\nLong Lake, south of the Lonely Mountain and east of Mirkwood. It seems\nthat the town's prosperity was built on trade between the Men, Elves and\nDwarves of northern Middle-earth.\n\nIt was also known as the final resting place of the Dragon Smaug, whose\nbones ended up at the bottom of the lake, and by whom it was destroyed.\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nLake-town may have been separate settlements established on the same\nsite, one predating Smaug's destruction of Dale and the Lonely Mountain\nin TA 2770 and the other built afterwards. Uniquely, of all of the\ntowns, settlements, fortresses, and cities of Middle-earth, Lake-town\nutilized water as its defense. The Long Lake was also surrounded by\ntowering cliffs and high mountains, all helpful natural barriers that\nhad the potential to aid its defenders in a siege (such as the\nEasterling invasion of the North in TA 3018). While these defenses\nslowed and diverted Lake-town's human enemies, it did nothing to prepare\nits inhabitants against Smaug. The villagers would be harassed on a\nregular basis by Smaug. Smaug would steal an occasional maiden or just\nburn down their homes.\n\nLake-town was founded sometime during the Third Age and its inhabitants\ntraded extensively with the Elves of Thranduil's Woodland Realm, the\nDwarves of the Lonely Mountain and the Iron Hills, their kin in Dale and\nDorwinion to the south, and possibly with the Easterlings (in times of\npeace, of course). The Men of Lake-town traded with Dorwinion (a human\nrealm on the fertile coastal plain on the west shore of the Sea of Rhûn)\nin a unique way; wine barrels were floated down from Thranduil's caverns\nin Mirkwood (the Elves were known as copious wine drinkers, as found in\nthe Hobbit) along the Celduin down to Lake-town, where they were\nredirected to Dorwinion. The wine was then paid for and filled with the\nnecessary goods before being shipped back north, and the cycle of trade\nresumed once more. These barrels were also quite large, for they could\nfit a Hobbit or Dwarf (even the extremely fat Bombur).\n\n\n\nIt is also where Bilbo and the Dwarves travelled in their adventure to\nreclaim the Lonely Mountain. In the year TA 2941 of the Third Age the\ntown was attacked by the dragon, but Bard the Bowman, who had indirectly\nlearned of a weakness in Smaug's armor that had first been noticed by\nBilbo Baggins, slew the dragon. Smaug, livid\nwith bestial fury, had winged his way to the town in the dead of night\nand promptly began to immolate the wooden matchwood structures there,\nmaterials that burst into flame at the slightest provocation. Its\ninhabitants realized all too late their predicament and while some,\nincluding most of the women and children, got away safely on boats, many\nperished in the maelstrom of fire that ensued. A brave company of\nspearmen and archers attempted, in vain, to shoot down the dragon, but\nwere mostly immolated themselves. It wasn't until Bard managed to kill\nthe dragon, that the destruction finally ended. The town was wrecked by\nthe dragon, but afterwards it was rebuilt using some of the treasure\nthat Smaug had stolen, though the town's Master ran off with some of the\nGold. Part of the town's population followed Bard to resettle the\nKingdom of Dale.\n\nAs trading people, the Men of Lake-town knew the Common Speech, Westron.\nHowever, amongst themselves they spoke an ancient form of it, which was\nloosely related to but distinct from the also ancient language of the\nRohirrim. Tolkien “translated” Westron into English in his text, so to\nrepresent its ancient relative that the Rohirrim spoke he substituted\nOld English. Thus, Tolkien substituted Old Norse for the language of the\nMen of Esgaroth (in person and place names, etc.) because it is an\nancient relative of English that is related to Old English.\n\nAfter the town's near destruction following Smaug's rage, its\ninhabitants rebuilt it with more splendor and grandeur further down the\nlake. LAKE-TOWN is used to refer to the pre-Smaug town upon the Long\nLake, while the rebuilt, larger cousin further down the waterway is\nreferred to as ESGAROTH. The inhabitants also learned a crucially\nimportant, but painful, lesson bought with the blood of loved ones: the\ntown was built to be less susceptible to flame and its military was\nexpanded. These lessons greatly aided it during the War of the Ring.\n",

Throughout the\nages, Hildórien faced the East Sea and continued to do so ever after.\n\n\nHistory\n\nAccording to legends of the Edain, Morgoth visited Men in Hildórien and\nconverted them away from Eru Ilúvatar tricking them into believing they\nwere made mortals as a punishment.

    "text": "This is an overview of the COSMOLOGY of J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth\nlegendarium. Each entry is followed by any alternate names, any roughly\ncorresponding primary world name in parentheses, and a brief\ndescription. A question mark after the primary world name indicates that\nthe identification may be partially speculative or disputed.\n\n-   TIMELESS HALLS, (Heaven) - The home of Eru (God) outside of Time.\n    They are similar to Heaven in that they exist outside the boundaries\n    of the universe and in that they do not have a physical form. It is\n    unknown whether they are the final destination of the souls of Men.\n    This is a distinct possibility, however. In fact, it is confirmed in\n    the tale of Adanel that Men return to Eru, but it is questionable\n    that this tale can be considered canon, although Christopher Tolkien\n    once considered putting it in the appendices of the Silmarillion.\n\n-   THE VOID, Avakúma, Kúma, the Outer Dark, the Eldest Dark, the\n    Everlasting Dark - An abstract, uninhabited region of nothingness\n    described as existing outside the Timeless Halls, Arda, and all of\n    Eä. It is possible that the Void outside of Eä and the one\n    surrounding Arda were different, but this is not clearly defined. No\n    being in the Void can use any power they possess within the Void.\n    Melkor was cast into THE VOID after the War of Wrath, but legend\n    predicts his return to the world before the end, in Dagor Dagorath.\n\n-   EÄ, (the Universe) - EÄ is the Quenya name for the universe, as a\n    realization of the vision of the Ainur. The word comes from the\n    Quenya word for _to be_. Thus, Eä is _the World that Is_, as\n    distinguished from _the World that Is Not_. It may thus be assumed\n    that everything outside Eä, including the Timeless Halls of\n    Ilúvatar, has no material form. The Ainur, angelic beings from the\n    Timeless Halls beyond Eä, refer to it as “the Little Kingdom”. This\n    refers to the fact that within the mind of Eru Ilúvatar (God), all\n    creation that humans can see is really just a tiny thing in\n    comparison. _Eä_ was the word spoken by Eru Ilúvatar by which he\n    brought the universe into actuality.\n\n    -   ARDA, Ilu - See Arda. The world, including everything in the\n        skies around it.\n\n        -   VAIYA, Ekkaia, the Enfolding Ocean, the Encircling Sea,\n            (Outer space) - A dark sea that surrounds the world before\n            the cataclysm at the end of the Second Age. Vaiya flows\n            completely around the world, forming a sea below it and a\n            form of air above it. Arda is described as floating on\n            Vaiya, like a ship on a sea. Ulmo, the Lord of Waters,\n            dwells in Vaiya, below the roots of Arda. Vaiya is described\n            as extremely cold. Where its waters meet the waters of\n            Belegaer in the northwest of Middle-earth, a chasm of ice is\n            formed, the Helcaraxë. Vaiya cannot support any ships except\n            the boats of Ulmo; the ships of the Númenóreans that tried\n            to sail on it sank, drowning the sailors. After Arda was\n            made round, Vaiya apparently disappeared, although it may\n            have been changed into the upper atmosphere of the world.\n\n            -   ILMEN, (the Solar system) - A region of clean air\n                pervaded by light before the cataclysm at the end of the\n                Second Age. The stars and other celestial bodies are\n                found in this region. Tolkien likely derived its name\n                from _ilma_, the Finnish word for air. The Moon passes\n                through Ilmen on its way around the world, plunging down\n                the Chasm of Ilmen on its way back.\n\n                -   ALCARINQUE, Morwen, Silindo, (Jupiter?)\n\n                -   ANARRIMA\n\n                -   ANOR, Ur, (the Sun) See Sun.\n\n                -   BORGIL, (Aldebaran?)\n\n                -   CARNIL, (Mars?)\n\n                -   EARENDIL’S STAR, Gil-Amdir, Gil-Estel,\n                    Gil-Oresetel, Gil-Orrain, (Venus)\n\n                -   EKSIQILTA, Ekta-, (Orion’s Belt)\n\n                -   ELEMMÍRË, (Mercury?)\n\n                -   HELLUIN, Gil, Nielluin, Nierninwa, (Sirius)\n\n                -   ITHIL, Silmo, (the Moon) See Moon.\n\n                -   LUINIL, (Uranus?)\n\n                -   LUMBAR, (Saturn?)\n\n                -   MENELVAGOR, Daimord, Menelmacar, Mordo,\n                    Swordsman of the Sky, Taimavar, Taimondo,\n                    Telimbektar, Telimektar, Telumehtar, (Orion) - A\n                    constellation meant to represent Túrin Turambar and\n                    his eventual return to defeat Melkor in The Last\n                    Battle.

It also formed the\n                    symbol of Durin, seen on the doors of Moria, and\n                    inspired a song of defiance from Beren. According to\n                    the _Silmarillion_, it was set in the Northern Sky\n                    as a sign of doom for Melkor and a sign of hope for\n                    the Elves. The Valacirca is one of the few\n                    constellations named in the book, another\n                    significant one being Menelvagor.\n\n                -   WILWARIN, (Cassiopeia?)\n\n                -   VISTA, Air, (the Atmosphere) - Vista is the\n                    breathable air.\n\n                    -   FANYAMAR, Cloudhome - The upper air where clouds\n                        form.\n\n                    -   AIWENÓRË, Bird-land - The lower air where the\n                        paths of birds are found.\n\n                        -   AMBAR, Imbar, (Earth) - The actual solid\n                            land mass of the world.

The name probably means “Land of\nthe King”, from Sindarin ARA- (high, kingly) + (N)DOR (land).\n\n\nHistory\n\nArnor was founded in SA 3320 by Elendil and sons who went on to found\nthe southern realm of Gondor. The history of the two kingdoms is\nintertwined; both kingdoms are known as the Realms of the Dúnedain in\nExile.\n\nBefore the foundation of Arnor there was already a sizable Númenórean\npopulation living there, a result of the slow emigration of Númenóreans\nwhich had started under Tar-Meneldur and Tar-Aldarion. Before the\narrival of the Dúnedain, Arnor was home to Middle Men of Edain stock,\nand the early colonists soon interbred with the indigenous population.\nArnor was originally favoured over the more southern regions (Gondor)\nbecause the Elves under Gil-galad lived near it across the river Lhûn.\nHowever, in later days after the Númenóreans fell under Sauron's shadow\nthey settled more to the south. This led to a situation where Elendil\narrived in an area populated by people who, unlike his own Númenóreans,\nwere mainly still friends with the Elves, and unlike Gondor to the south\nin Arnor much knowledge of the Elder Days was preserved.\n\nArnor's second king Isildur (also King of Gondor) was killed in TA 2 by\norcs in the disastrous Battle of the Gladden Fields. His three eldest\nsons were killed with him, but the fourth and youngest, Valandil,\nsurvived and became king of Arnor (TA 2 or 10?).\n\n\n\nBecause Valandil and his heirs did not claim the throne of Gondor the\nrealms were split, but Arnor's ruler kept the title High King, whereas\nin the south the ruler was just _King._ At its height, Arnor borders\nextended from the Ice-Bay of Forochel in the north, the river Greyflood\ndown to Belegaer in the south, the river Hoarwell in the east, and the\nriver Lune in the west. The capital city was Annúminas, and the realm\nincluded other cities such as Fornost, Tharbad, Lond Daer, and Tyrn\nGorthad.\n\nDecline\n\nHuman folly and the plots of a deathless evil had undone this dream.\nArnor was no more; divided into the three kingdoms of Arthedain,\nCardolan and Rhudaur, the Dúnedain of the North spent their strength in\nfoolish, petty wars and while corruption and ambition sapped their\nstrength, enemies gathered on their frontiers. Arnor's capital was\nAnnúminas on Lake Evendim, but by TA 861 Fornost Erain had become the\ncapital instead as Annúminas became depopulated.\n\nAfter the death of its tenth king, Eärendur, in 861, Arnor was shaken by\ncivil war between the three sons of Eärendur. The eldest son, Amlaith,\nclaimed Kingship over all Arnor but was reduced to only ruling the\nregion of Arthedain as his kingdom, while the other sons founded the\nkingdoms of Cardolan and Rhudaur.\n\nArnor was refounded in name by Arthedain's king Argeleb I, when Cardolan\nplaced itself under the suzerainty of Arthedain. However, even Arthedain\nwas eventually destroyed. The people of Arnor were mostly wiped out by\nthe wars, but the Hobbits survived in the Shire, men survived in Bree\nand probably other villages, and the Dúnedain of Arnor created new homes\nin the Angle south of Rivendell, where some of them became known as the\nRangers of the North.\n\nReunited Kingdom\n\nAragorn II as King Elessar refounded the Kingdom of Arnor as part of the\nReunited Kingdom, and made Annúminas his summer capital. After the fall\nof Sauron, Arnor was safe again for human population, and although it\nremained less populated than Gondor to the south, in time Arnor became a\nmore densely populated area again, even when it had dwindled in size due\nto the independence of the Shire.",

    "text": "VALINOR (Quenya; IPA: ; also\nVALINÓRË; ; meaning _Land of the Valar_), the Land_' across the Sea_',\nwas the realm of the Valar in Aman; the place to which they migrated\nafter being driven from Almaren by Melkor in times before the First Age.\nIt was also known as the Undying Lands as only immortal souls were\nallowed to reside there, with some exceptions when it came to the\nbearers of the One Ring; and additionally, even Gimli, who accompanied\nhis friend Legolas to these lands.\n\n\nLay of the land\n\nIts major city was Valmar, where the Vanyar and the Valar resided. Two\nother cities were Alqualondë and Tirion, the respective homes of the\nTeleri and the Noldor. It also had an island, Tol Eressëa, just off its\neast coast.\n\nValinor as explained was the home of the Valar, the Powers of\nMiddle-earth. The sea to the west of the island was called Ekkaia, or\nthe Encircling Sea; it surrounded both Valinor and Middle-earth.\n\nEach of the Valar had their own region of the land where they resided\nand altered things to their desire. Yavanna, the Vala of nature, growth,\nand harvest, resided in the Pastures of Yavanna in the south of the\nisland. Orome, the Vala of the hunt, lived in the Woods of Orome to the\nnorth-east of the pastures. The forest was home to many creatures which\nOrome could track and hunt. Nienna, the lonely Vala of sorrow and\nendurance lived cut off in the far west of the island in the Halls of\nNienna where she spent her days crying, looking out to sea. Just south\nof the Halls of Nienna and to the north of the pastures there were the\nHalls of Mandos. Mandos, the brother of Nienna, was the Vala of the\nafterlife. All inhabitants of Middle-earth went to the Halls of Mandos\nshould they happen to die, mortals and immortals alike (immortals could\nbe killed although they did not die of old age) although it was said\nthat in death as in life, they were separated. Also living in the Halls\nof Mandos was his spouse Vairë the weaver, who wove the threads of time.\n\nTo the east of the Halls of Mandos was the Isle of Estë, which was\nsituated in the middle of the lake of Lorellin which in turn was\nsituated to the north of the Gardens of Lórien (not to be confused with\nLothlórien in Middle-earth which was created by the same Valar, Lórien\nalso known as Irmo, the Vala of dreams). Este and Lórien being husband\nand wife lived close together. To the north of this were the Mansions of\nAule the smith Valar who was spouse to Yavanna. In the north-east lay\nthe Mansions of Manwe and Varda, the two most powerful Valar, also\nmarried. To the west of them stood the Trees of Valinor, Telperion and\nLaurelin. The entire great island of Valinor was surrounded on three\nsides (excluding the north which was instead protected by ices flows) by\na huge mountain range called the Pelóri mountains. In the extreme\nnorth-east, past the mountain range was the pass of Helcaraxë, a vast\nand treacherous ice sheet which in the beginning, before the fall of\nNúmenor, joined the two continents of Valinor and Middle-earth. In the\nbeginning, the Noldor, tricked by the evil Vala Melkor passed along this\npass to go back to Middle-earth, among those was Galadriel who was\nfeatured in the War of the Ring. Those who took this pass were not\nallowed back to Valinor for many years, but in the end pity was taken on\nthem when Middle-earth began to fade and pass into the age of men and\nthey were allowed to pass back to the Undying Lands of their own accord\nwhen they felt ready to do so.\n\nAlso, for a time after the exile of the Noldor and before the ruin of\nNúmenor, a long chain of small islands called the Enchanted Isles ran\nthe full length of the east coast to the continent. The enchanted\nislands and a bewildering shadow created the Shadowy Seas, which to\nprevent mariner, mortal or immortal, from reaching the land by sea (by\nthe Belegaer, the Great Sea which separated Middle-earth and Valinor.\nUntil the Changing of the World in the center of this sea was the isle\nof Númenor. This defence lasted centuries until Eärendil was guided\nthrough the Shadowy Seas by the light of the Silmaril brought on board\nby his wife Elwing. They sailed on Vingilot, said to be the fairest ship\never fashioned, constructed by Earendil and Cirdan the shipwright.\n\nAfter the destruction of Númenor and the Changing of the World, the\nUndying Lands were no longer a physical part of Arda so that Men could\nno longer sail to Aman or Tol Eressea. Only the Elves could sail there\nby the Straight Road and in ships capable of passing out of the Spheres\nof the earth.\n\nBy special permission of the Valar, the Hobbits Frodo Baggins, Bilbo\nBaggins, and Samwise Gamgee were also permitted to go to Valinor, and\nLegolas the elf brought with him Gimli the Dwarf.\n",

    "title": "Gondor",
    "page_id": "163",
    "text": "GONDOR was the prominent kingdom of Men in Middle-earth, bordered by\nRohan to the north, Harad to the south, the cape of Andrast and the Sea\nto the west, and Mordor to the east. Its first capital was Osgiliath,\nmoved to Minas Tirith in TA 1640. The city of Minas Tirith remained the\ncapital of Gondor for the rest of the Third Age and into years of the\nFourth Age; other major fortresses include Dol Amroth in Belfalas and\nOsgiliath, which was a city on the Anduin.\n\nGondor was founded by the brothers Isildur and Anárion, exiles from\nNúmenor. Gondor was an allied kingdom with Arnor, whose line of king\nchieftains came from Isildur, while the Line of the Kings of Gondor was\nfrom Anárion. Gondor was at the height of its power in its early years\ndue to the ships and the military might that its armies possessed.\nHowever, continued attacks by allies of Sauron, civil war, and a\ndevastating plague caused it to gradually decline over the course of the\nThird Age until Sauron's final defeat and the crowning of Aragorn II\nElessar. Following that time the power of Gondor once again expanded,\nuntil the former lands of Arnor were brought under the banner of the\nReunited Kingdom. \n\nIn all, there were thirty-one kings of Gondor after Anárion, who was\nslain before Barad-dûr at the Siege of Barad-dûr. \n\n\nHistory\n\nLike Arnor to the north, Gondor was a Mannish kingdom founded by\nAnárion, the youngest son of Elendil, after the Downfall of Númenor. It\nwas located to the South of Rohan and to the West of Mordor, on the Bay\nof Belfalas.\n\nEarly years\n\n Before the Downfall of Númenor,\nGondor was home to many Númenórean colonists, who either mixed blood\nwith the indigenous Middle Men if they were friendly, or dispersed them\ninto Ras Morthil, Dunland, and Drúadan Forest. Gondor, at a latitude\ncomparable to Venice, was a more fertile region than Arnor to the north,\nand therefore it already had a larger population before the ships of\nElendil's sons arrived, including a well-established city, Pelargir.\n\nThe Faithful or Elendili from Númenor were given a warm reception upon\ntheir arrival by those that had already colonized Middle-earth,\nincluding a colonial branch of Númenorean royalty at Dor-en-Ernil. The\ncolonists north of Anduin accepted Elendil's claim to kingship over\nthem. South of the Great River, however, the newly exiled Númenoreans\ndid not recognize Elendil's claim.\n\nGondor was being founded after Númenor's population had already split\nbetween The Faithful and King's Men, and all of the more southern\ncolonies (such as Umbar) remained enemies of The Faithful.\n\nThe newly founded kingdom of Gondor was then part of the Last Alliance\nof Elves and Men which overthrew Sauron for the first time at the very\nend of the Second Age, and when Isildur cut the finger of Sauron.\n\nGondor Prospers\n\nAfter the war, Gondor's power and wealth grew steadily (only interrupted\nby an Easterling invasion in TA 492). Its power would continue to grow\ninto the 9th century Third Age. While the power of Gondor's sister\nkingdom Arnor peaked during the 9th century, when it broke into various\nsuccessor states, Gondor's greatest glory was yet to come. Gondor's\ngreat cities Minas Anor, Minas Ithil, Osgiliath and Pelargir only grew\nand the Dunedain of Gondor started to rule over more and more of the\nlesser people.\n\nGondor's Golden Age\n\n\n\nGondor's power reached its Golden Age under the four “Ship-kings”:\n\n-   Tarannon Falastur r. TA 830 – TA 913. First of the Ship-Kings, died\n    childless\n-   Eärnil I r. TA 913 – TA 936. Nephew of Tarannon\n-   Ciryandil r. TA 936 – TA 1015\n-   Hyarmendacil I (Ciryaher) r. TA 1015 - TA 1149. Last of the\n    Ship-Kings. In the reign of the powerful king, Hyarmendacil I (c.\n    12th century TA) Gondor reached the height of its power. During\n    Hyarmendacil's reign, Gondor's borders reached their furthest\n    extent. The Kingdom extended east to the Sea of Rhûn, south to the\n    nearest lands of the Haradrim, as far north as Mirkwood, and west\n    towards the borders of Arnor.\n\nSuch was Gondor's wealth during the period that men from other lands\nwould say in envy: “In Gondor precious stones are but pebbles for the\nchildren to play with.” Gondor would also enjoy several centuries of\npeace due to its military might.\n\n\n\nThe Decline of Gondor\n\nHowever, after decadence spread under the Kings of Gondor and a long\nperiod of decline began (although Gondor experienced several revivals).\nThree great calamities struck Gondor during the second millennium of the\nThird Age, which are held to be the chief reasons for its decline: the\nKin-strife, the Great Plague, and the invasion of the Wainriders (a\ntribe of Easterlings).\n\nThe Kin-strife\n\nIn the 15th century TA a great civil war named the Kin-strife tore the\nnation apart. The current King Eldacar was of mixed blood: his mother\nwas of the Northmen. Popular displeasure at this led to the overthrow of\nKing Eldacar by Castamir, the admiral of all of Gondor's naval forces\nwho possessed some royal blood. Eldacar's son was slain, and he fled\nnorth. Castamir was afterwards known as Castamir the Usurper. During his\nten-year rule, he proved to be very cruel, and because of his love of\nhis old fleet, he lavished attention on the coastal regions while the\ninterior provinces were ignored and left to rot. Eldacar then returned\nwith an army of his Northman kinsmen, and the armies of the Men of\nGondor joined them from interior provinces such as Anórien. Osgiliath\nwas devastated during this conflict, its great bridge destroyed and its\n_Palantír_ lost. Eldacar slew Castamir and reclaimed his throne, but\nCastamir's sons and their forces were besieged in Pelargir, the great\nport of Gondor. They eventually retreated to Umbar, where they joined\nwith the Corsairs, and troubled Gondor for many years, until their\ndescendants died out.\n\nThe Great Plague\n\nLater, the Great Plague struck and the White Tree died. This Plague was\nno localized event: the Plague swept through all of Middle-earth,\nreaching the successor states of Arnor and the Hobbits of the Shire in\nthe North. King Tarondor found a sapling of the White Tree, and moved\nthe capital from Osgiliath to Minas Anor, the City of Anárion. During\nthis time, Gondor was so depopulated that the fortifications guarding\nagainst the re-entry of evil into Mordor were abandoned. It is believed\nthat had the Haradrim or Easterlings been capable of attacking Gondor at\nthis time, it would have fallen. However, the Plague left Gondor's\nenemies in no better condition than Gondor itself, and neither side was\ncapable of mounting new offensives.\n\nThe Invasion of the Wainriders\n\nFollowing the sapping of Gondor's strength by the plague, it did recover\nbut then the Wainrider (Easterlings) invaded and devastated Gondor, and\nthe conflict lasted for almost a century. The Wainriders destroyed the\nNorthern Army of Gondor, but survivors linked up with the victorious\nSouthern Army of Gondor which destroyed the Haradrim as they crossed the\nriver Poros, led by a general named Eärnil, and they destroyed the\nWainriders as they celebrated their victory during the Battle of the\nCamp.\n\nThe Line of the Kings Fails\n\nReunification Rejected\n\nIn TA 1944 Gondor faced a succession crisis when King Ondoher was slain\nin battle with both his sons. Arvedui, Prince of Arthedain, Ondoher's\nson-in-law, and the victorious general Eärnil, who was a distant\nblood-relative of Ondoher, claimed the throne. Arvedui's claim lay\nmainly in the reintroduction of the old Nùmenorean law of accession,\nwhich stated the eldest (remaining) child should succeed the king. If\nthe law was reintroduced, then Arvedui's wife Fíriel, Ondoher's daughter\nand last remaining child, would become Ruling-Queen, making their\ndescendants Kings of both Arnor and Gondor. Arvedui also tried to put\nweight behind his claim, as he was Isildur's heir. The council of Gondor\nrecognised that the name of Isildur was held in honour in Gondor, but\nthey dictated that the South-Kingdom must be ruled by an Heir of\nAnarion. Due to his ancestry from Fíriel and Arvedui, more than a\nmillennium later, Aragorn Elessar put forward his claim as the heir of\nboth Isildur and Anarion.\n\nEärnil laid his claim as being a direct descendant of King Telumehtar\nUmbardacil. His claim was also greatly bolstered by the popularity he\nhad gained as the victorious general who saved Gondor from the\nWainriders after winning the southern theatre of the war. Steward\nPelendur who was temporarily ruling Gondor as serving as arbiter of\nsuccession, intervened in favour of Gondor's victorious general who\nwould rule as Eärnil II.\n\nThe Last Heir of Anárion\n\nDuring the Battle of Fornost, Eärnil II's heir Eärnur led Gondor's\nforces to victory over the Witch-king of Angmar, who was actually the\nLord of the Nazgûl. Although Eärnur wished to fight him, Eärnur's horse\nwas terrified and fled the battle against his wishes. By the time, he\nmastered his horse and returned the Witch-king had fled. Glorfindel the\nElf then prophesied to him that it was better that he not fight the Lord\nof the Nazgûl because “never by the hand of man shall he fall”.\n\nEärnur later ascended to the throne, ruling from Minas Anor (“Tower of\nthe Sun”). During this time, the Ringwraiths captured the city of Minas\nIthil (“Tower of the Moon”), renaming it _Minas Morgul_ (“Tower of Dark\nSorcery”) and taking it as their lair. Minas Anor was renamed _Minas\nTirith_ (Tower of Guard) as a result. The Lord of the Nazgûl repeatedly\nsent messengers to Minas Tirith challenging Eärnur to single combat,\ntaunting him that he had fled out of cowardice from facing him during\nthe Battle of Fornost. Eventually, King Eärnur was overcome by wrath and\nrode with a small company of knights to Minas Morgul, to accept the\nchallenge. They were never heard from again; and so ended the Line of\nAnárion.\n\nThe Stewards of Gondor\n\nThe Ruling Stewards\n\nA long line of hereditary Stewards governed the realm after the\ndisappearance of Eärnur, son of Eärnil, since there was no proof that\nthe last king was dead, and no claimant had enough support to be\naccepted as his successor. The line of Anárion was held to have failed,\nand Gondor was not willing to risk to another Kin-strife, which would\nsurely have destroyed it. Whenever there was a new Steward, he would\nswear an oath to yield rule of Gondor back to the King, in essence only\nan heir of Isildur, if he should ever return. In Gondor, there was no\none who could claim descent from Isildur in direct line, and the\nnorthern line of Arnor had effectively disappeared, so this oath was not\nconsidered seriously. The line of Stewards ruled as Kings, without\nhaving the title. During the War of the Ring, the ruling Steward of\nGondor was Denethor II, and his two sons were Boromir and younger\nFaramir- the latter being the last Ruling Steward of Gondor.\n\nCirion and Eorl\n\nIn TA 2510 when Steward Cirion ruled over Gondor, the nation faced one\nof its greatest perils: an Easterling tribe named the _Balchoth_ invaded\nGondor with mass force. Gondor's army marched to fight the Balchoth but\nwere cut off from Minas Tirith and pushed back in the direction of the\nLimlight.\n\nMessengers were sent to get help from the Éothéod, a tribe, which lived\nin the northern vales of the Anduin, but nobody expected the messengers\nto reach their destination. When certain peril came upon Gondor,\nhowever, the Éothéod turned the tide of the Battle of the Field of\nCelebrant. After the victory the Éothéod were awarded the fields of\nCalenardhon north of the White Mountains from the Gap of Rohan at the\nsouthern end of the Hithaeglir, Fangorn forest, rivers Limlight to\nAnduin, western Emyn Muil, and the Mering Stream, where they established\nthe kingdom of Rohan with Eorl the Young as their first king. A\npermanent alliance between Gondor and Rohan was established by the oath\nEorl swore to Cirion.\n\nThe War of the Ring and the Restoration\n\nSeveral centuries later, Sauron had prepared for the final conquest, and\nin TA 3018 his forces overran Ithilien. The attack was stopped at\nOsgiliath with the destruction of the bridge across the Anduin. The\nfollowing year Minas Tirith faced a larger attack from Mordor, with\nadditional threat from the Corsairs of Umbar. Aragorn summoned the Dead\nMen of Dunharrow to destroy the forces from Umbar, freeing forces in the\nsouth of Gondor to come to the aid of Minas Tirith. Gondor then defeated\nthe army of Mordor with the aid of the Rohirrim in the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields, though with heavy losses. The combined army of the West\nthen carried the battle to Sauron at the Battle of the Morannon, a feint\nto distract Sauron's attention from Frodo Baggins's quest to destroy the\nOne Ring in Mount Doom, thus causing Sauron's destruction and the\nallies' ultimate victory.\n\nAfter the second and final defeat of Sauron, the Kingship was restored,\nwith Aragorn crowned as King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor\nand Gondor. Faramir, last heir of the Ruling Stewards, retained his\noffice as the Steward to the King, and ruled over Gondor's eastern\nregion of Ithilien; a fair land between the river Anduin and the Ephel\nDúath. The oaths between Gondor and Rohan were renewed, and several\njoint campaigns were fought in the east and south against the remnant of\nthe Easterlings and Haradrim; all former territories of the\nSouth-kingdom were won back during the following centuries, and its\npower and wealth were restored. Several Tolkien's writings state that\n_“...of Eldarion son of Elessar it was foretold that he should rule a\ngreat realm, and that it should endure for a hundred generations of men\nafter him, that is until a new age brought in again new things; and from\nhim should come the kings of many realms in long days after”_.\n\n\nArmies\n\nSecond Age\n\nThe soldiers of Gondor were renowned during the Second Age for their\nskill and valour. Training men of Gondor during the Second Age instilled\nwithin their soldiers a martial spirit and ardor, goading them to fight\nto the death against the hordes of Mordor, Rhûn, and Harad. Every man\nwas physically imposing: being very tall at over six feet, very broad,\nand very strong as well. Every single soldier was in peak fighting\ncondition and ready to fight against Sauron's hordes (especially during\nthe War of the Last Alliance). The three major weapons they used were\nspears, longswords, and longbows. They also knew how to form cohesive\nbox-formations, which were sturdy enough for both offensive and\ndefensive purposes. The soldiers wore heavy plate armour and utilised\nlarge shields made out of multi-layered wood and edged in metal for\nreinforcement.\n\nThird Age\n\nGondor's armies prevented Mordor and its allies from overwhelming the\nrest of Middle-earth. Gondor was in a very crucial position, in order to\nguard Middle Earth and because of Gondor's proximity to Mordor, its\nmilitary forces had to be proficiently trained and vigilantly on guard\nat all times. Because of this, they were arguably the strongest country\nthat opposed Sauron. During the Third Age, most of Minas Tirith's armies\nwere trained and drilled to fight in tight infantry formations,\nsupported by archers and cavalry. Their armaments consisted of a\nchainmail undercoat with either a black tabard or plate armor over it.\nTheir standard weapons were long spears, longswords, and longbows,\ncomplimented by tower shields. \n\nMinas Tirith's immediate defenses comprised thousands of infantrymen\nstationed throughout Osgiliath, Cair Andros, and the Rammas Echor. These\nunits were most likely temporary detachments from the city. Minas Tirith\nalso had at least three companies of the elite Guards of the Citadel,\ntasked to defend the upper levels of the city. They wore black robes,\nsurcoats and winged silver crowns. The Guards of the City were not\nallowed to go in the main part of the City in their uniform.\nAdditionally, the sixth level of the city housed stables for a small\nforce of horsemen. Beyond Anduin and the defenses of Minas Tirith\noperated a secretive group of soldiers called the Rangers of Ithilien\nThe Rangers of Ithilien had guerrilla warfare aginst the Southrons,\nallies of Mordor. Similar to the Rangers of the North, the Rangers of\nIthilien were comprised of the remnant of the Dúnedain in their\nrespective Kingdom, in this case being the Dúnedain that once dwelled in\nIthilien.(the Rangers of the North were Arnorian Dúnedain, while the\nRangers of Ithilien are Gondorian- and were more populous than their\nnorthern kin).  Armed with longbows, swords, and spears, these men\nwatched and harassed the enemy throughout Ithilien, much akin to\nguerrilla warfare. The captain of the Rangers of Ithilien during the War\nof the Ring was Faramir, the younger brother of Boromir and the son of\nthe Steward of Gondor, Denethor II.\n\nThe defense of Gondor's fiefdoms were the responsibility of the\nrespective lords of these territories. Their training, strength in\nnumbers, and armaments varied from each fief (Lossarnach brought axemen\nto the aid of Minas Tirith while the men of Morthond Vale consisted of\narchers). The greatest of these fiefs was Dol Amroth, which brought\nforth the largest force to Minas Tirith, made up of men-at-arms and\narguably the best cavalry in Middle Earth- the elite Swan Knights.\n\nGondor's fleet at the time of the War of the Ring was docked at\nPelargir. This port and the Anduin River was essential in the defense of\nMinas Tirith. As made evident by the fiefdom's dire need to defend their\ncoasts and many rivers of Gondor, a majority of the fleet was\nconcentrated at Pelargir. This fleet was destroyed when the Black Ships\nof Umbar attacked, enslaving many of Gondor's sailors into the service\nof Mordor.\n\n\nSong of Gondor\n\n_Gondor! Gondor, between the Mountains and the Sea!_\n\n_West Wind blew there; the light upon the Silver Tree_\n\n_Fell like bright rain in gardens of the Kings of old._\n\n_O proud walls! White towers! O wingéd crown and throne of gold!_\n\n''O Gondor, Gondor! Shall Men behold the Silver Tree, ''\n\n_Or West Wind blow again between the Mountains and the Sea?_\n\nThis was sung by Aragorn on his trip with Legolas and Gimli to find\nPippin and Merry.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Gondor_ name means 'Land of Stone', from Sindarin GOND (stone) + (N)DOR\n(land), most likely given to it because of the White Mountains (Ered\nNimrais) and other mountain chains in the land (hypothetical Quenya name\nONDONÓRË).\n\n\nRegions of Gondor\n\n  Gondor was divided between several nearly\nautonomous regions. These were the following:\n\n-   Ithilien, a region along the east bank of the Anduin river under the\n    shadow of the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow). Ithilien was\n    abandoned and mostly under the control of Mordor during The War of\n    the Ring. (Although Gondor did have secret bases throughout the\n    region such as Henneth Annûn, and the Rangers of Ithilien used\n    guerilla warfare tactics to harass the enemy throughout Ithilien,\n    and disrupt supply lines and companies marching to and from Mordor.\n    After the War of the Ring, Faramir was made Lord Paramount of\n    Ithilien by Aragorn.\n-   South Ithilien, a portion of the the Ithilien south of Osgiliath.\n    The road (the Harad Road) the Southrons took to get to Morder lied\n    here.\n-   Anórien, a strip of land along the northern edge of the White\n    Mountains. Bordered by the Mering Stream and Rohan to the west,\n    Anduin to the east, the Mouths of Entwash to to the north, and\n    theWhite Mountainsand Rammas Echor to the south.\n-   Lossarnach, a heavily-populated farmland region southwest of Minas\n    Tirith.\n-   Lebennin, a plain extending from the White Mountains down to the Bay\n    of Belfalas that bordered Lossarnach.\n-   Belfalas, a fiefdom ruled by the Princes of Dol Amroth.\n-   Dor-en-Ernil, a narrow strip of land along the Bay of Belfalas ruled\n    by the Princes of Dol Amroth.\n-   Lamedon, a plain between the White Mountains and the River Ringló.\n-   Anfalas or _Langstrand_, a narrow strip of land along the sea\n    bordered by the Pinnath Gelin.\n-   Andrast, The western-most province of Gondor located on a narrow\n    peninsula jutting out into the Sea.\n-   Ringló Vale, a mini-province.\n-   Morthond or Blackroot Vale, where Duilin comes from.\n\nThe long cape of Andrast was not populated (by the descendants of\nNúmenóreans, but evidence from the _Unfinished Tales_ suggests that a\nsmall group of Púkel-men inhabited it.)\n\nAdditionally, Gondor held or had held the following regions at certain\npoints in its history:\n\n-   South Gondor or Harondor, an arid region between the rivers Porosand\n    Harnen, which was contested between Gondor and Harad.\n-   Calenardhon, which was given to the Éothéod and became Rohan. It's\n    boundaries were the rivers of Anduin in the east, Isenin the west,\n    Limlightin the north, and the White Mountains/ Mering Stream in the\n    south.\n-   Enedwaith, a region between the rivers Isen and Greyflood. It was\n    never truly populated by Gondor and was soon abandoned.\n-   Rhovanion, which was never fully under the control of Gondor but\n    under Gondorian control at certain times during the Third Age.\n-   Ephel Dúath, the Mountains of Shadow, which was the extreme eastern\n    region of Gondor where she kept watch over Mordor with many\n    fortresses and cities such as Minas Ithil, Durthang, and the Tower\n    of Cirith Ungol. Evil things re-entered Mordor after Gondor's watch\n    upon the land slackened during the Second Age.\n\n\nMajor Sites\n\n Cities, Fortresses, and Strongholds in Gondor included:\n\n-   Cair Andros, an island-fortress in the river Anduin, roughly 40\n    miles north of Osgiliath. Gondor maintained a steady garrison here,\n    as it was of paramount importance to Gondor during the long war with\n    Mordor, in order to prevent the enemy from crossing the river and\n    entering into Anórien.\n\n\n\n-   Calembel, a city in Lamedon.\n-   Dol Amroth, a city in Belfalas ruled by the Prince of Dol Amroth.\n-   Ethring, a ford and a large township built on either side of the\n    river Ringló.\n-   Henneth Annûn, a hidden refuge of Gondorian rangers in the northern\n    part of Ithilien along the Ephel Duath, the Mountains of Shadow.\n-   Linhir, a port city in Lebennin.\n-   Minas Tirith (originally Minas Anor), City of the Kings, the capital\n    (Third Age) and largest city of Gondor.\n-   Osgiliath, a city and former capital of Gondor on the river Anduin,\n    largely destroyed and abandoned by the end of the Third Age. During\n    the War of the Ring, Gondor kept a garrison on the west bank to\n    prevent the Enemy from crossing the river and assaulting Minas\n    Tirith. Osigiliath was the key to besiege Minas Tirith because of\n    its location and access to the river. Although the massive\n    Morgul-host led by the Witch-King to beseige Minas Tirith\n    overwhelmed the garrison, and drove the Gondorians out thus gaining\n    the passage of Anduin- the true beginning of the Siege of Gondor\n    that would conclude at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. King\n    Elessar had it rebuilt after Sauron's downfall.\n-   Pelargir, the great southern harbour, which was captured by the\n    Corsairs during the War of the Ring. The people of Pelargir helped\n    in the Batttle of Pell\n-   Tarnost, a hill-town in Belfalas.\n\nAdditionally, Gondor had held the following locations at certain points\nin its history:\n\n-   Angrenost (Isengard), one of the three Fortresses of Gondor and held\n    within it one of the realm's Palantiri. Its location in Nan\n    Curunir (valley at the end of the Misty Mountains), was at the\n    northwestern corner of the Southern Kingdom of Gondor, guarding the\n    Fords of Isen from enemy incursions into Calenardhon, and together\n    with the fortress of Helm's Deep to its south protected the Gap of\n    Rohan. After Calenardhon was given to the Éothéod by Cirion, Steward\n    of Gondor and became Rohan, Isengard remained part of Gondor, and\n    the company of Aglarond removed to the northern fortress, although\n    the rest of Gondor almost forgot about it. The small guard\n    intermarried much with the Dunlendings , until the place became a\n    Dunlending fortress in all but name. Orthanc, however, remained\n    closed, as the Steward of Gondor still held the keys. Isengard soon\n    came all but deserted.\n-   Durthang, the largest fortress in Mordor, originally built to guard\n    the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow)..\n-   Erech, a town of Gondor that was abandoned by the end of the Third\n    Age. To the north lay the Paths of the Dead.\n-   Minas Ithil, a city founded by Isildur that was originally the\n    sister city of Minas Anor. Located in an upland valley at the feet\n    of the Mountains of Shadow, it was built as a fortress city to\n    defend Gondor from Sauron in Mordor. It was later conquered by\n    the Nazgûl and renamed Minas Morgul.\n-   Tharbad, a city on both sides of the river Greyflood, (at one time\n    held by Gondor in the south and Arnor in the north) but abandoned as\n    Gondor's borders recessed through Enedwaith to the Isen, and later\n    ruined.\n-   Tower of Cirith Ungol, a Tower Fortress in western Mordor built by\n    Gondor to guard the pass of Cirith Ungol from any evil creature\n    trying to enter -or leave- Mordor. The Great Plague wiped out the\n    garrison located here, so it was easily captured when Sauron's\n    minions re-entered Mordor.\n-   Towers of the Teeth, two towers situated on either side of the Black\n    Gate. The two towers, called Carchost and Narchost, that stand on\n    either side of Cirith Gorgor, the Haunted Pass, which lies between\n    the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow), and the Ash\n    Mountains. Originally built by Men of Gondor following the downfall\n    of Sauron at the end of the Second Age, the Towers of the Teeth were\n    eventually taken over by the servants of the Dark Lord. They were\n    then repaired and fortified and were incorporated into the defenses\n    of the pass and gate.\n-   Umbar, the far southern harbour which was lost and reclaimed several\n    times, in the end being the home of Black Númenóreans, the Corsairs\n    of Umbar.\n",

    "title": "Lindon",
    "page_id": "248",
    "text": "LINDON was a Elven Kingdom founded by Gil-galad at the beginning of the\nSecond Age. It was the longest-standing Eldarin Kingdom in the history\nof Middle-earth, and the mightiest throughout the Second Age. It was\nruled by its founder, Gil-galad, the High King of the Ñoldor, who,\nduring that age, was the strongest and most powerful enemy of Sauron in\nMiddle-earth.\n\nThe realm endured through the Third Age, though diminished, and was the\nsite of the Grey Havens, where the Elves, as well as the Ring-bearers,\nsailed to the Undying Lands.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nLindon was located in what remained of Ossiriand; the Land of Seven\nRivers and all that was left of the peninsula of Beleriand after the War\nof Wrath. The mountains, partially sunk in the ruin of Beleriand,\nformed a portion of the realm's east border. The realm reached as far\nnorth over the mountains as the Little Lune. North of that boundary was\nwhat remained of the Dwarf kingdom of Belegost. After the ruin of\nBeleriand, Gil-Galad founded the realm of Lindon, which encompassed all\nthe land west of the Blue Mountains and east of the sea in the North of\nMiddle-earth. The Gulf of Lune broke the realm of Lindon into Forlindon\nand Harlindon. The Grey Havens lay at the mouth of the river Lune.\nThrough a break in the Blue Mountains, the land of Eriador lay to the\neast, and farther southeast laid the Shire. Eastward also lay the\nKingdom of Eregion, at the feet of the Misty Mountains, which was also\nruled by Gil-Galad under the lordship of Celebrimbor. Towards the\nend of the Second Age, the realm of Arnor was established by Elendil to\nthe northeast of Lindon.\n\nThe lands of Lindon were said to be lush and green, with thick forests\nlining the foothills of the Blue Mountains. The havens of the elves were\nfound along the Gulf of Lune, where the land became rocky yet lush along\nthe coast. Tolkien stated that Lindon was Elven country “where no Man\ndwells”. It was the last realm that was fair and free. It also had a\nmildly tempered climate, with mild winters and mild summers.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the Second Age\n\n_Lindon_ was another name for the Ossiriand in East Beleriand, where the\nLaiquendi dwelt.\n\nSecond Age\n\nAfter the War of Wrath, those Elves who had sought refuge on the coast\nof the sea at the mouths of the river Sirion removed into the land that\nwas left in the northwest of Middle-earth. They, led by Gil-Galad,\nestablished the realm of Lindon in SA 1. In the North at Forlindon\nGil-galad ruled a majority of Noldorin Elves. In southern Harlindon,\nCeleborn ruled a fiefdom of many Sindar and the remaining Green Elves of\nBeleriand under Gil-Galad. He did not rule under Gil-galad for long,\nthough, eventually removing to the shores of Lake Nenuial with his wife,\nGaladriel. At the Grey Havens Círdan was the lord of many shipbuilders\nof the Teleri who survived the ruin of the First Age. The Elves believed\nnow that the threat of Morgoth was removed, and Lindon became a fair\nkingdom. Gil-galad and the Elves of Lindon had a very strong friendship\nwith Númenor and its kings before the Darkening of Númenor.\n\nEarly in the sixth century of the Second Age, the first ships of Númenor\nreturned to Middle-earth. Vëantur, father-in-law of Tar-Meneldur, led\nthe first expedition. Later he returned with his grandson and heir to\nthe throne, Aldarion, and the Númenoreans were well liked by Gil-galad\nand his people. Tar-Aldarion continued his voyages to Lindon throughout\nhis reign as the sixth King of Númenor, and Gil-galad and Círdan taught\nmuch to the mariners of Númenor. Gil-galad befriended Aldarion and gave\nhim and his father, Tar-Meneldur, many gifts. After the reign of\nAldarion, Númenor was less active in the affairs of Lindon for many\nhundred years, though friendship remained.\n\nIn the twelfth century, Sauron attempted to infiltrate Lindon disguised\nas 'Annatar', the Lord of Gifts. His strength now on the mend after\nMorgoth's defeat, Sauron purposed to corrupt the strongest of all the\nremaining Elf-kingdoms. Gil-galad denied him, and so did Elrond, who\ndwelt then with the King in Forlindon. Though they did not know\nAnnatar's true identity at the time, the wise king of Lindon foresaw\nevil in Annatar. Sauron then turned his attention to Eregion, where he\nsucceeded in befriending the Noldorin smiths under Celebrimbor who\nworked there.\n\n\n\nAfter Sauron forged the One Ring at the beginning of the sixth century,\nhe declared war on the Elf-kingdoms to capture the Rings of Power they\nhad hidden from him. Gil-galad sent a small army led by Elrond east to\nthe aid of Eregion. There he joined with Celeborn, but Sauron's forces\ndefeated the combined force. His army ravaged Eregion and the rest of\nEriador, and came to the borders of Lindon. There, Gil-galad's forces\ndug in against the forces of Sauron, and were strengthened by a great\nfleet sent from Númenor by Tar-Minastir, the King of Númenor, under his\nson and heir Ciryatan. With the aid of the Númenoreans, participating in\ntheir first war upon Middle-Earth, Lindon was freed and Sauron's forces\noverthrown. Sauron returned to Mordor and focused his attention now on\nruining Númenor.\n\nIn the year SA 3319 of the Second Age, Númenor was destroyed, and\nElendil and sons and his remnant of Faithful Númenoreans landed on the\ncoast of Middle-earth. Elendil established the Realms in Exile which\nwere the North-Kingdom of Arnor and the South-Kingdom of Gondor. He\nbecame close friends and ally with Gil-galad, and they pledged support\nto one another against the preparing blow of Sauron, who had risen to\npower once again after fleeing the ruin of Númenor.\n\nThe War of the Last Alliance began in SA 3434, and the Elves of Lindon\nformed a large part of the backbone of the Elven armies. Elendil's\nNúmenorean refugees, along with Dúnedain who had removed to Middle-Earth\nbefore the destruction of Númenor, marched alongside the host of\nGil-galad, and eventually they laid siege to the Dark Tower. Sauron\nhimself then came to battle, and fought Gil-galad and Elendil. The two\nkings defeated him but died in the process. Then, Isildur son of Elendil\ncut the ring from Sauron's hand, and he was for a time defeated.\n\nThird Age\n\nAfter the death of Gil-galad, the lordship of Lindon passed to Círdan;\nand the line of Noldorin kings in Middle-Earth came to an end. The\npopulation of Lindon had been reduced by the long and bloody war with\nSauron. With the loss of their king, many of the Noldor and Sindar left\nfor Valinor. Following the war, many Elves began to come to the Grey\nHavens and sail to Valinor, further depleting Lindon's population.\nCírdan continued his shipbuilding, and had much work constructing the\nvessels to carry the Elves west. However, the kingdom began to dwindle\nas the ships continued to sail.\n\nThe Witch-king of Angmar attacked the Kingdom of Arnor in the thirteenth\ncentury of the Third Age. Lindon lent what aid it could to the Dúnedain,\nbut after many years, the North-Kingdom was overthrown. The Dúnedain\nwent into exile, and the kingdom of Lindon shrank rapidly into a safe\nhaven for the Elves of Middle-earth. By the time of the War of the Ring,\nit was a shadow of its former glory, with only Grey Havens seeing\nregular traffic and activity. After Sauron's defeat, the last Elves\nbegan to sail for Valinor, and Círdan remained there well into the\nFourth Age, awaiting the last ship to sail west himself.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _LINDON_ means “Land of the Singers”, from the Quenya term\n_lin_ or _lind_ (“to sing, make musical sound”) and _-on_, which\nis a common suffix for regions.",

The land was known in part for\nits cold and snowy weather.\n\n\nHistory\n\nLong before the Witch-king came to Angmar, the dwarves had many\nflourishing mines in the region, and halls that were secure and\nprosperous. It was not long before Durin's Folk felt the first assaults\nof Angmar. They fled southward, seeking the safety of their mines in the\nWeather Hills. \n\nThe Witch-king arose in Angmar during the realm of Malvegil of\nArthedain, at some time between TA 1272 and TA 1349. Men became aware of\nthe growing evil in the mountains, but Angmar was still preparing its\npower. No assaults on the Dunedain came until Argeleb I, the son of\nMalvegil, assumed the throne of Arthedain. \n\nIn TA 1356, the sub-realm Rhudaur was forced to invade Arthedain; many\nwere slaughtered including their king, Argeleb I. However, with the help\nof Cardolan's armies, Arthedain maintained a strong line of defense at\nthe foot of the Weather Hills. \n\n\n\nThen in TA 1409, Angmar attacked Cardolan and Rivendell and destroyed\nall the settlements within except Cardolan's capital, the Barrow-downs.\nAmon Sul was razed and burned and the Dunedain were forced to flee\nwestward. Arthedain was now left without any allies to aid it, and so\nbegan a mighty struggle lasting another 500 years.  \n\nHelp came from the Elves of the Grey Havens, Rivendell, and Lorien. The\narmies of Angmar were repelled from Fornost and the North Downs, and\nforced to withdraw to Angmar. The shadow of the North was contained for\na time.  \n\nAfter the Great Plague, which started from the east of Mordor in TA\n1636, the last of Cardolan's people died, allowing Barrow-wights to be\nsent from Angmar into the downs. \n\nDuring the time of TA 1974, Angmar multiplied its forces and launched a\nfinal assault on Arthedain. Subsequently, they took its capital Fornost,\nthereby defeating the last northern kingdom of the Dunedain.\n\nSometime later, Prince Eärnur - thirty-third and last King of Gondor -\narrived to aid Arthedain, but he found he was too late. His army\ndefeated the forces of Angmar in the Battle of Fornost, and the\nWitch-king fled to Mordor, leaving the kingdom of Angmar to fall in TA\n1975.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Angmar_ meant 'Iron home' in Sindarin.\n",

    "text": "The WHITE TREE OF GONDOR was the symbol of the realm of Gondor, growing\nin the Court of the Fountain at Minas Tirith. The White Tree was also\nthe motif of Gondor's flag.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThis iconic tree was in appearance a tall spacious tree of graceful\nform, white thin unwrinkled bark over white wood. In spring it bore\nnumerous white flowers, but few of these ever fructified; what shape the\nfruit was is never described, nor is it considered to be edible. The\nleaves were laurel-like, dark green above and bright silver beneath. The\nwood when burned gives off a dense, choking, volumnious smoke that forms\na fog capable of burying an entire country in darkness for several days.\n\nIt was fashioned in the image of Telperion, elder of the Two Trees of\nValinor, originally. This image was given to the Elves of Kortirion in\nValinor and named Galathilion. From it a sapling was taken to Tol\nEressëa, named Celeborn. This in turn sired the tree Nimloth of Númenor,\nfelled by Sauron and burned on the altars.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFirst White Tree\n\nThe first White Tree of Gondor came from a fruit that Isildur, at great\npersonal risk, managed to steal from Nimloth the Fair, the White Tree of\nNúmenor, before that one was destroyed at Sauron's insistence. He\nsuffered many wounds at this mission, and he came near death, but when\nthe first leaf opened in the spring, Isildur was healed of his wounds.\n\nThis sapling was brought to Middle-earth on Isildur's ship, and it was\neventually planted in Minas Ithil before the house of Isildur.

After the\ndeath of its tenth King, Eärendur, his sons had divided Arnor into the\nkingdoms of Arthedain, Rhudaur and Cardolan.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe borders of Cardolan extended from the river Brandywine to the west,\nthe river Hoarwell  to the east and the river Gwathló\n(Greyflood) to the east and south. Its northern border was the Great\nEast Road, but Cardolan also claimed the Arthedain-controlled Weather\nHills, which contained the fortress of Weathertop and its valuable\nPalantír. For this reason the Weather Hills were claimed by all three\nkingdoms - Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur. This territorial dispute\ncontinued until Rhudaur became a vassal of Angmar after the line of the\nDúnedain kings failed there.\n\nWhen the kingdom of Angmar arose in northern Eriador, Cardolan became\nthe most important ally of Arthedain. It had to fight the combined\narmies of both Angmar and Rhudaur. It soon became apparent that Cardolan\ncould not hold back the forces of Angmar and in its last years the\npeople became entrenched in the hill region, Tyrn Gorthad (the\nBarrowdowns). This position became untenable after Angmar sent evil\nspirits to inhabit the downs (the Barrow-wights). Arthedain could\nprovide little aid, as it was itself under attack. Around TA 1409\nCardolan was destroyed, and its former inhabitants accepted the King of\nArthedain as their lord. Arthedain managed to reconquer the land\nbriefly, but few people wished to live there on account of the\nBarrow-wights, and so Cardolan was never re-populated. \n\nAfter the final fall of Arnor, and the destruction of Angmar at the\nBattle of Fornost, Cardolan remained an unpopulated area until the\nreestablishment of the northern kingdom under King Aragorn II Elessar at\nthe end of the Third Age. Until then, the region was largely\nunclaimed and known as Minhiriath.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Cardolan_ appears to be a dialect Sindarin word for 'Red Hill\nLand'.",

Amlaith, the\ntrue heir to the throne of Arnor, was opposed by his two brothers.\nUnable to resolve the situation, he was reduced to ruling the region of\nArthedain, which consisted approximately of the lands west of the\nBrandywine River and north of the Great East Road. (His brothers created\nthe kingdoms of Cardolan and Rhudaur to the south.)\n\nThe kingdom's capital was at Fornost, and Bree was one of its most\nimportant towns. Annúminas was in the territory of Arthedain, but mostly\nabandoned and falling into ruin.\n\nIn TA 1300 the kingdom of Angmar appeared at Arthedain's north-eastern\nborder. Its King was the chief of the Ringwraiths, although this was not\nknown to the Dúnedain. When this new threat came Cardolan placed itself\nunder the suzerainty of Arthedain, which then began to call itself ARNOR\nagain. Cardolan repeatedly sent aid to Arthedain when needed but by TA\n1409 Cardolan and Rhudaur were conquered by Angmar.\n\nArthedain kept up the resistance against Angmar for over 500 years but\nin TA 1974 Arthedain was overrun and Fornost fell into the hands of\nAngmar. It fell just one year too soon for help was underway from Gondor\nunder the lead of Eärnur. This army reached Arthedain in TA 1975 and\ndestroyed Angmar at the Battle of Fornost.\n\nIts last King, Arvedui, drowned just before the battle was fought. The\nkings of Arthedain were also the lords of The Shire and the Shire chose\nthe Thain to replace the kings.\n\nThe son of Arvedui, Aranarth decided not to rebuild the kingdom and so\nbecame the first Chieftain of the Dúnedain.

The deepest of the caves\nwas the Innermost Chamber where Glaurung later hoarded up the remaining\ntreasures of Nargothrond and sat upon them until he left. Lúthien lived\nin a southwestern cave chamber during her stay there. The realms\narmouries were in several chambers south of the Great Halls. The main\nentrance through the Doors of Felagund to Nargothrond facing river Narog\none came into a large chamber, which was about five-hundred feet from\nthe Great Halls of Felagund.\n\n\nHistory\n\nYears of Peace\n\nInspired by Menegroth in Doriath, and seeking a hidden place from which\nto be safe from the forces of Morgoth, Finrod established it in the\nearly years following the return of the Ñoldor to Middle-earth, in the\nCaverns of Narog beneath the forested hills of TAUR-EN-FAROTH on the\nwestern bank of Narog. He was aided by the Dwarves of Nogrod who also\nmade for him the Nauglamír, the Necklace of the Dwarves.\n\nHowever, Finrod was not the first to delve in those caves: it had first\nbeen inhabited by the Petty-dwarves, who called it NULUKKIZDÎN (Khuzdul\nIPA: ) before they were driven out. Originally, a narrow path along the\nbanks of the river could only reach it, but later a bridge was built\nacross the Narog.\n\nFinrod ruled Nargothrond until he joined Beren in his Quest for the\nSilmaril, being succeeded by his nephew Orodreth. However, the Sons of\nFëanor, Celegorm and Curufin lived in Nargothrond at this time and\ncarried a great influence with its people, sowing fear and distrust of\noutsiders. After Finrod's death was reported they were exiled in\ndisgrace.\n\nFall of Nargothrond\n\n[Túrin and Glaurung, by woutart \n\nSince its foundation by Finrod, the Elves of Nargothrond had pursued a\nsecretive war against Morgoth, hunting his forces by stealth and ambush\nrather than going to open war. When Túrin was led there by Gwindor,\nhowever, he grew high in the esteem of Orodreth, Lord of Nargothrond,\nand counseled a different strategy.\n\nTúrin Turambar became one of the chief captains, persuading the people\nto abandon their long standing policy and instead fight openly against\nMorgoth.\n\nTúrin persuaded Orodreth to build the Bridge of Nargothrond to allow\nspeedy passage of forces into the field. Orodreth built the bridge from\nhis doors across the Narog, and went to open war with Morgoth. In\ncenturies of searching, Morgoth had been unable to find the fortress of\nNargothrond, but now not only was its location revealed, but the new\nbridge removed the defence of the River Narog. Glaurung the dragon was\nsent out from Angband with an army of Orcs to capture the city. After\nthe defeat of the army of Nargothrond at the field of Tumhalad in FA\n495, Glaurung and his army of Orcs came south, crossed the bridge, and\nsacked the city, killing or selling some of the inhabitants into\nslavery. The survivors, then went to seek refuge in Doriath, and that's\nhow Thingol knew of the fall of Nargothrond.\n\nGlaurung remained there until FA 499 when he went northeast to Brethil,\nto confront Túrin Turambar who eventually slew him. Though the realm was\nno more, Mîm the Petty-dwarf took up residence in caves claiming it and\nits treasures as his own in payment for the sufferings of his people,\nuntil Húrin came and slew him for his betrayal of his son. The treasure,\nincluding the Nauglamír, was then brought to the Elven Kingdom of\nDoriath and given to King Thingol. Afterwards, the caves were\ndestroyed during the War of Wrath, along with all of Beleriand.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_NARGOTHROND_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Narog-fortress-vaulted\nhall'.",

    "text": "RHUDAUR was the smallest of the kingdoms that originated from the\nbreak-up of Arnor in TA 861. The other kingdoms were Arthedain and\nCardolan.\n\n\nHistory\n\nRhudaur formed the eastern part of Arnor, and stretched from the Weather\nHills with Weathertop to the river Loudwater. It shared a long border\nwith Cardolan along the Great East Road, and with Arthedain along the\nline of the Weather Hills.\n\nThe land between the rivers Hoarwell and Loudwater was also considered\npart of Rhudaur. It was called _the Angle_, and it is here that the\nfirst Stoor Hobbits came into Eriador around TA 1150. However, due to\nthe increasing hostility of Angmar these Stoors fled the region around\nTA 1356, with some of them moving west to the Shire, and others moving\nback to Wilderland.\n\n\n\nFrom the start of its existence, Rhudaur was unfriendly towards the two\nother successor states, and took part in a bitter conflict with\nArthedain over the Tower of Amon Sûl and the Palantír associated with\nthe tower.\n\n\n\nThe last Kings of Rhudaur were not of Númenórean blood, but were\ndescended of Men in service of Angmar. Under their rule the land became\na vassal of Angmar, and thus enemies of Cardolan and Arthedain.\n\nAngmar annexed and terminated the kingdom in TA 1409. By this time, the\nDúnedain were gone from the region, as well as most of the other\ninhabitants.\n\nThere is evidence that after the fall of Angmar at the Battle of Fornost\nthe Angle became home to the remainder of the Dúnedain, and the Rangers\nof the North established several villages there, where their people\nlived until the resurrection of the northern Kingdom under King Aragorn\nII Elessar at the end of the Third Age.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe _Haeranedain_ (S.“Far Wandering Edain”) were Rhudaurians of\nNúmenorean descent, most were actually mix-blooded Tergil. Most\nRhudaurian Dúnedain belonged to one of seven greater Noble Houses of\nHiri, House Amrothar, House Eldanar, House Enedil, House Melosse, House\nMithlad, House Rhudainor and House Rómentir.\n\nThe name Rhudaur appears to be dialect Sindarin for 'East Forests',\n\nThe _Rhudaurians_ (S.“Rhudaurim”) were the inhabitants of the fallen\nkingdom of Rhudaur, in the closer sense those of númenorean blood, the\nHaeranedain, in a wider sense all those eriadorian tribes living inside\nthe borders of Rhudaur including:\n\n-   the Hillmen of the Trollshaws and Coldfells\n-   the Vulseggi or northrons of the Egladil\n-   the Dunmen of the southern borderlands to Eregion and Cardolan\n-   the Forodrim of the Northern marches\n\n\nAppearance\n\nThe Haeranedain were a bit smaller and darker than the high Dúnedain,\nalthough 6 ft for men was not uncommon.\n\nIn daily life most had adapted clothes much similar to those of the\nindigenous Hillmen, the _Kailth_, a skirt or kilt, and the _Kullodoo_.",

Although it was colonized by\nShire-hobbits, it was not formally a part of the Shire until early in\nthe Fourth Age, hundreds of years after it was founded.\n\n\nLocation, Villages and Borders\n\nBuckland is located east of the Brandywine river. The hobbits living in\nBuckland grew the High Hay, a hedge, to protect themselves against any\nevil from the nearby Old Forest, which borders Buckland to the east.\nBuckland is bordered in the north by the Hay Gate, the only entrance to\nBuckland near the Brandywine Bridge. In the south, the borders of\nBuckland follow the High Hay until the Withywindle joins the Brandywine\nnear the village of Haysend. The most important town of Buckland is\n_BUCKLEBURY_ where Brandy Hall is located, home of the Master of\nBuckland, one of the important officials of the Shire.\n\nAn important landmark is the _BUCKLEBURY FERRY_, a raft-ferry used as\nthe second main crossing point of the Brandwine river from the Shire to\nBuckland, after the Brandywine Bridge (which is twenty miles further\nnorth). It is apparently left unmanned to be used by hobbit travellers\nas needed. En route to the new house at Crickhollow, Frodo Baggins, Sam\nGamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took crossed using the Ferry\njust before the arrival of a Black Rider, who was forced to go around to\nthe Brandywine Bridge as there were no boats kept on the western bank of\nthe river. \n\n\nHistory\n\nBuckland was settled around TA 2340 (SR 740) by Gorhendad Oldbuck, the\nancestor of Meriadoc Brandybuck. Gorhenhad Oldbuck thus became the first\nMaster of Buckland. He renamed himself Brandybuck, which remained his\nfamily's name.\n\nBecause Buckland is east of the Brandywine, it isn't part of the land\ngiven to the Hobbits by King Argeleb II of Arthedain. It was thus not\npart of the Shire proper until the beginning of the Fourth Age when King\nElessar made Buckland, now renamed the EASTMARCH, and the Westmarch\nofficial parts of the Shire.\n\n\nCulture\n\nThe Bucklanders are unlike other hobbits as they are prepared for danger\nand are thus less naive than the Shire-hobbits. They close the Hay Gate\nand their own front doors at night and are prepared to rush to arms when\nthe Horn of Buckland is blown.

Translated into English, it reads, “_Sting_ is my name; I am the\nspider's bane.” The Appendix of ''The Silmarillion _defines_ _the\nelement _maeg'' in Sindarin as meaning “sharp” or “piercing”. During the\nThird Age, it was wielded by Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins, and Samwise\nGamgee.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nSting was an ancient Elvish blade made by weapon-smiths in Gondolin.\nWhen Orcs or goblins were within an undetermined radius of it, the blade\nglowed blue, alerting the wielder and others who could see it to their\npresence. It had been lost during the Fall of Gondolin, the same battle\nin which Turgon fell and Glamdring was taken. It appeared as a curved\nblade with a silver loop or spiral design on it, later runes were added\nto it by Bilbo after his adventures. These runes seem to have been made\nby the Elves as they are in Sindarin.\n\nIn _The Hobbit_, Bilbo and his dwarven companions found Sting in a\nTroll-hoard alongside two other elven blades: Glamdring and Orcrist.\nThough just a dagger by the standard of elves, Sting made a perfect\nshort sword for a Hobbit, although it was still rather small, as Bilbo\ninitially chose to wear it “inside his breeches” and was still able\nto travel and even run without any apparent inconvenience.\n\nJust before his nephew embarked on his quest to Mordor from Rivendell,\nBilbo gave Sting to Frodo. Sam then took the weapon from his (seemingly\ndead) master and used it to good effect against Shelob on the borders of\nMordor. After the defeat of Sauron at the end of the Third Age, Frodo\nentrusted Sting to Sam and it became an heirloom of the Gamgee family.\n\nGollum, who disliked anything made by the Elves, was afraid of Sting.\nThis fear aided Bilbo when he confronted Gollum in the Cave at the base\nof the Misty Mountains in _The Hobbit_. It also helped Frodo and Sam\nsubdue Gollum in _The Lord of the Rings_. Orcs also had an instinctive\nfear of these weapons and hated any who carried them.\n\nAs is fitting for a blade of Gondolin, Sting could easily cut through\nthe webs of the offspring of Ungoliant, including the evil Shelob and\nthe spiders of Mirkwood. Bilbo had named the weapon _Sting_ after he had\n“stung” one of them with it. In The Hobbit when Bilbo wears the One\nRing, and defends himself against a spider, he names the blade “Sting”.\nThe narrator describes the spider's lack of acquaintance with creatures\nwith such stings, and evidently this was also Bilbo's presumption in\nnaming it as such. Sting was like Glamdring and Orcrist in that “being\nthe work of Elvish smiths in the Elder Days these swords shone with a\ncold light, if any Orcs were near at hand.” But only Sting was\ndefinitively described as glowing blue, or glittering with blue flame at\nits edges.\n",

With her\nsister realm, Nogrod, Belegost was dug deep beneath Mount Dolmed in the\nBlue Mountains in the Ages of Stars.\n\nAmongst the Dwarves of Belegost were the finest smiths and stone-carvers\nin Middle-earth. In their armourer's halls they made many bright weapons\nand were the first people to forge chain-mail. The Dwarves of Belegost\ntraded with the Sindar Elves of Beleriand and supplied them with weapons\nof incomparably tempered steel; furthermore these Dwarves carved the\nstone chambers of Menegroth. One of their payments for these services\nwas Nimphelos, a great pearl.\n\nIn the First Age, the Dwarves of Belegost and their lord, Azaghâl, won\ngreat fame in the War of the Jewels. In the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the\nDwarves alone could withstand the heat of the Dragon-fire because being\na race of smiths were used to great heat and on their helms they wore\nmasks of steel. Their axes too that they forged were strong enough to\nhold the Dragons in check. Though Azaghâl was slain, he wounded\nGlaurung, the Father of Dragons and the Dragon brood fled the\nbattleground, all the way back to Angband. The Dwarves of Belegost\nwere asked by the Dwarves of Nogrod for aid in their war against\nDoriath, but were refused.\n\nAt the end of the First Age, Belegost was ruined in the War of Wrath,\nand around the fortieth year of the Second Age, the Dwarves of the Blue\nMountains began to migrate to Khazad-dûm, abandoning Nogrod\nand Belegost.\n\n\nInhabitants\n\nIn the twelfth volume of _The History of Middle-earth_, _The Peoples of\nMiddle-earth_, an essay appears entitled _Of Dwarves and Men_ which\nsheds some light on the people of Belegost. Circumstantial evidence\ngiven there suggests that the Dwarves of Belegost were unrelated\nto Durin's Folk, the Longbeards that appear in Tolkien's better-known\nwork, and instead belonged to a different clan, either the Firebeards or\nthe Broadbeams. The word-order used there suggests that Belegost was\nfounded by the Broadbeams, while nearby Nogrod was populated by the\nFirebeard clan.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Belegost_ was a Sindarin word for “mighty or great fortress”.

It was there that the One\nRing was lost by Isildur and found again a long time later by Déagol the\nStoor.\n\n\nGeography\n\nThe fields started near the mouth of the river Gladden, and went on\nbeyond where it joined the Great River, extending onto its eastern\nbanks. It was a region of many dark pools and islets, with beds of reeds\nand rushes and many wildflowers - a particularly common flower being the\nYellow Iris, which grew there in profusion.\n\nIn ancient times when the Silvan Elves were in the region, there was a\npool or lake at the intersection of the two rivers; however, over time\nthis receded, forming the marshes.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIt was in the Gladden Fields that Isildur and his sons were travelling\nto Rivendell when they were assailed by Orcs in TA 2. Isildur, in an\nattempt to escape, jumped into the river, using the Ring to keep hidden.\nHowever, the Ring slipped from his finger as he swam away, landing in\nthe riverbed, and Isildur was slain by the Orcs' arrows on the bank of a\nsmall islet.\n\nThe fields were later settled by Stoors around TA 1356. The Ring\nremained undiscovered.\n\nAround two and a half millenia after the ambush, in TA 2463, the Hobbit\nDéagol found the ring when he was fishing with his cousin Sméagol: an\nespecially large fish pulled him under the water and, spotting it\namongst the weeds, he took it to the bank. Ensnared by the Ring's power,\nthe two fought over it, and ultimately it went to Sméagol, who killed\nDéagol and later became the creature called Gollum.\n\nLater, around TA 2851, Saruman began searching the wetlands for the\nRing. He found the Elendilmir, the token of Royalty of the\nNorth-kingdom, which Isildur had been wearing at the time of the attack.\nAt the meeting of the White Council that year, Saruman overruled\nGandalf's suggestion that they purge Sauron from his stronghold in Dol\nGuldur.\n\nSauron also sent his servants to search for the Ring. When the White\nCouncil learned of this, they agreed to an attack on Dol Guldur to\nprevent Sauron from finding the Ring, in TA 2941. At the meeting of the\nWhite Council in TA 2953, Saruman pretended that he had learned that the\nRing had been carried downriver to the Sea.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nGladden Fields was Sindarin for LOEG NINGLORON.",

It was a realm\nof forests about the great river Sirion; within it were the forests\n_Neldoreth_ (also _Taur-na-Neldor_, the northern beech forest), _Nivrim_\n(also West-march, an oak forest), and _Region_ (pronounced Reh-gi-on,\nthe main forest). Additionally, the forests of _Brethil_ and ''Nan\nElmoth ''were considered to be under the influence of Thingol, though\nnot under his direct command and laying outside of the Girdle of Melian.\nEöl the Dark Elf leased Nan Elmoth from Thingol, having paid with the\nsword Anglachel. The People of Haleth, or the Haladin, lived in Brethil\nwith the permission of Thingol. They governed themselves, but cooperated\nwith the march-wardens of Doriath. King Elu Thingol of Doriath, also\nHigh King of the Sindar, saw all of Beleriand as his realm, from the\nGelion to the Belegaer (the Sea).\n\n\nHistory\n\nYears of the Trees\n\nThe Vanyar and Ñoldor had passed by it on the Great Journey, and had\nbeen ferried across on Tol Eressëa by the time the Teleri arrived. Then\ntheir lord Elwë was lost in Nan Elmoth, and when Ulmo returned for them,\na part remained behind. They became known as the Sindar or Grey Elves,\nand when Thingol returned he became their king, ruling from Doriath.\n\nThe forests of Neldoreth and Region were located in the center of\nBeleriand, and were the abode of King Thingol and Melian. Their people\nwere the people of the Teleri who did not heed the call of the Valar to\npass over the sea to Valinor. All the Elves of Beleriand, from the\nshipbuilders under Círdan in the Falas, to the hunters of the Blue\nMountains, held Thingol as their lord. During the First and Second Ages\nof the Chaining of Melkor, Beleriand was peaceful. However, by the end\nof the First Age, Melian forebode that evil was to come, and Thingol\ncalled on the aid of the Dwarves of Belegost to aid in constructing a\ncity-fortress for the protection of his people. They also helped make\nfor them a store of stronger and better weapons that were better able to\ndeal with the Orcs of north. This was built under ground along the\nsouthern side of the River Esgalduin, and was called Menegroth, which\nbecame Thingol's capital.\n\nFor the most part, the Elves lived in scattered bands throughout\nBeleriand, only gathering in larger numbers in Neldoreth and Region\n(together called Eglador), and along the Falas. During the Third Age of\nthe Chaining of Melkor, Thingol proceeded to arm his people with the aid\nof the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost against the continued foreboding\nof Melian.\n\nAfter Melkor's release, his attack on the Two Trees with Ungoliant, and\nflight to Middle-earth, the situation for Beleriand suddenly worsened.\nUngoliant fled south from the Balrogs after her confrontation with\nMelkor, now Morgoth, and was only checked by the power of Melian. Some\ntime after, the forces of Morgoth left the freshly delved Angband and\nassaulted Beleriand from east and west in the First Battle of Beleriand.\nIn the east, King Thingol lead the forces of Beleriand, with the aid of\nDenethor and his Nandor and elves from Ossiriand, and completely\ndefeated the Orcs of the eastern army. Denethor was killed on Amon Ereb,\nand some of his people merged themselves to the Sindarin Elves under\nKing Thingol. Upon returning to Menegroth, Thingol learned that the\nwestern army of Morgoth had overrun the Falas. Thingol recalls all of\nhis people he can into Neldoreth and Region, and Melian puts forth her\npower and rings the region in a girdle of enchantment called the Girdle\nof Melian. At that point, the region formally called Eglador comes to be\nformally known as Doriath, the Guarded Kingdom.\n\nThe First Battle is the only time King Thingol leads his forces into\nbattle outside of his realm for the entirety of the First Age of the\nSun. Afterwards, the Elves of Doriath fight defensively, guarding their\nborders and the important river crossings nearby.\n\nFirst Age\n\n\n\nWhen the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth at the beginning of the First\nAge, Thingol refused to allow them in Doriath, with the exception of the\nchildren of Finarfin, who were related to him by his brother Olwë.\n\nWhen later Men arrived in Beleriand, they were also refused entry, but\nat Finrod's request the Haladin gives his permission for the People of\nHaleth to dwell in Brethil, who ally themselves with Doriath and aid\nthem in its defense.\n\nThroughout the rest of the First Age, while the Noldor fight their wars\nwith Morgoth, Doriath stands inviolate and generally aloof, refusing to\ntake part in the wars. Ultimately, however, King Thingol is pulled into\nthe doom surround the Noldor as was told in the Lay of Leithian, when\nBeren, son of Barahir and lord of the First House of Men, passed through\nthe Girdle as Melian had foretold, and arrived in Neldoreth.\n\nRealizing that his beloved daughter Lúthien had fallen in love with him,\nKing Thingol decreed that he would not allow them to marry unless Beren\nwould undertake a quest to recover a Silmaril from the Dark Lord\nMorgoth, and so begins the Quest for the Silmarils. After the Quest for\nthe Silmaril, the Wolf Carcharoth also breached the Girdle, but Thingol,\nBeren, and Thingol's captains Beleg and Mablung hunted and killed the\nbeast.\n\nAt the end of this, Thingol ended up in possession of one of the\nSilmarils. Beren and Lúthien, wedded together by fate and returning from\nthe dead, left Doriath to live in Ossiriand. After the Nirnaeth\nArnoediad, only three elven kingdoms remained: Nargothrond, Gondolin,\nand Doriath. Nargothrond fell soon after, as told in the _Narn i Chîn\nHúrin_ (Tale of the Children of Hurin).\n\nFearing that the cruel Easterlings would enthrall her only\nson Túrin of Hithlum, Morwen sent him to Doriath where he would be safe\nuntil he came of age, when he fled from the land. Later his mother and\nsister, Morwen and Nienor lived there, until they were lost.\n\nHurin, captured at the Nirnaeth and released from Angband after the\ndeath of his son Turin, recovers the Nauglamir from the ruin of\nNargothrond. Traveling to Doriath, he throws it at the feet of Thingol\nin spite. Melian rebukes him, and Hurin, cured of the madness of Morgoth\nby Melian, lifts up the Nauglamir and presents it to Thingol before\nleaving Doriath, and vanishing from history.\n\nFall of Doriath\n\nHúrin brought the treasure of Nargothrond to Doriath after the fall of\nFinrod's realm, and Thingol enlisted the Dwarves of Nogrod to combine\nthe Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien with the Nauglamir, the Dwarves'\nNecklace. The Dwarves then attacked Thingol and slew him, stealing the\nnecklace, during the first Sack of Doriath. Melian then left, and with\nher, the protective Girdle thus ended the bliss of old that reigned in\nDoriath for thousands of years, and things would never be the same\nagain.\n\nThingol, in possession of the greatest work of the Elves (a Silmaril of\nFëanor) and Dwarves (the Nauglamir) decides to merge the two. He\nconvinces a large company of smiths from Nogrod to attempt to remake the\nNauglamir to incorporate the Silmaril, which they succeed in doing. Once\nthe work is complete, and the joint works of Elves and Dwarves sits\nglittering before Thingol, he moves to take it and put it on. The\nDwarves stop him, demanding it in payment. Thingol rebukes them with\nhaughty words, at which the Dwarves slay him. The Dwarves attempt to\nescape Doriath, but most are killed and the Nauglamir recovered. After\nThingol's death, Melian departs Doriath in grief and withdraws her power\nfrom Doriath. After telling Mablung to send word to Beren, she vanishes\nfrom Middle-earth and returns to Valinor. Doriath now lies\nundefended.\n\nTwo Dwarves return from Doriath and tell a twisted version of the events\nto their king in Nogrod. The Dwarves of Nogrod raise an army and assault\nDoriath in retaliation. The slaughter is great on both sides, but the\nDwarves end up victorious. Menegroth is ransacked, many of its people\nare killed, and the Dwarves begin the long trek for home laden with the\nspoils of war, including the Nauglamir. At Sarn Athrad, they are\nassaulted by a force of Green Elves led by Beren who, with the aid of\nthe Ents of Ossiriand, annihilate the Dwarven force and recover the\nSilmaril.\n\nDior Eluchîl, son of Beren and Lúthien and heir to Thingol, returns to\nDoriath with his wife Nimloth, their two sons Eluréd and Elurín, and\ntheir daughter Elwing. He begins to rebuild the fortunes of the kingdom\nand it is briefly restored. Beren takes the Nauglamir to Lúthien, who\nwears it, enriching their home on Tol Galen. However, Beren and Lúthien\nsoon die for the second time, leaving the world forever. The Nauglamir\nand its Silmaril are brought to Dior.\n\nSoon after, the Sons of Fëanor, following the Oath, demand the return of\nthe Silmaril. Dior refuses, and the Sons of Fëanor invade Doriath, at\nwhich point the Second Kinslaying occurs. Celegorm, Curufin, and\nCaranthir are killed, as is Dior, Nimloth, and Eluréd and Elurín. The\npeople of Doriath are killed or scattered, with Elwing taking the\nNauglamir and fleeing with a remnant of the people of Doriath to the\nMouths of Sirion.\n\nDoriath was never rebuilt and afterwards Doriath remained abandoned and\nunpopulated until it was sunk along with most of the rest of\nBeleriand.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Sindarin, _Doriath_ means “Land of the Fence”, from _dôr_ (“land”)\nand _iâth_ (“fence”). Its previous name _EGLADOR_ either means “Land of\nthe Forsaken” or “Land of the Elves”, because the inhabitants called\nthemselves “Eglath”. The High Elves called Doriath the “Land of the\nCave”, from the Ñoldorin _gath_ or _gatta_ (“cavern”)\n\n_GARTHÚRIAN_ was name ascribed to the land of Doriath in earlier\nversions of the accounts of the First Age (specifically in _The War of\nthe Jewels_)_._",

    "text": "OSSIRIAND (Sindarin IPA: ) was a region of the eastern Beleriand. It was\nalso known as the LAND OF SEVEN RIVERS.\n\n\nDescription\n\nOssiriand was the most eastern region of Beleriand during the First Age,\nlying between the Blue Mountains and the river Gelion. Along the\nnorthern shore of the Ascar ran the Dwarf-Road to Nogrod. The region was\nwarm and gentle, with coniferous woodlands.\n\nSeven rivers lay in the region of Ossiriand, and these are (from north\nto south):\n\n1.  River _Gelion_\n2.  River _Ascar_ or _Rathlóriel_\n3.  River _Thalos_\n4.  River _Legolin_\n5.  River _Brilthor_\n6.  River _Duilwen_\n7.  River _Adurant_\n\n\nHistory\n\nOssiriand was a green and forested land, and it was not populated by the\nSindar. In the early First Age before the rise of the Moon, a part of\nthe Telerin elven people called Nandor entered Ossiriand under their\nleader King Denethor, and were given permission by Thingol to settle the\nlands.\n\nAfter them the land was often renamed Lindon, for _The Singers_, after\nthe old clan-name of the Telerin which the Nandor still used in their\ntongue. They became known as the Laiquendi, or Green-Elves.\n\nThe Elves of Ossiriand participated in the first battle of the Wars of\nBeleriand. After their leader Denethor was killed in an orc-raid they\nchose no more leaders, and many of them moved to Doriath.\n\nAfter the Quest for the Silmaril, Beren and Lúthien lived their second\nlives in Dor Firn-i-Guinar on Tol Galen. In FA 470, their son Dior was\nborn here. After the death of Thingol, Beren laid an attack against\nthe Dwarves of Nogrod, leading an army of Nandorin Elves and Ents.\n\nOssiriand was the only part of Beleriand that survived the War of Wrath,\nbut Belegaer the Great Sea broke through the mountain chain at the\nformer riverbed of Ascar, creating the Gulf of Lhûn. In the Second\nAge and Third Age, the former lands of Ossiriand and Thargelion were\nknown as LINDON, where Gil-galad the High King ruled.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name OSSIRIAND means “Land of the Seven Rivers”, from the Quenya\n_otso_ (“seven”), Sindarin _sîr_ (“river”), and '' -ian(d)'',\nwhich is commonly used in the names of regions or countries.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nWhile conceiving a name, J.R.R. Tolkien had numerous choices for this\nland. He originally wrote Broseliand (which eventually led to\nBeleriand). The other names were Colodhinand, Ñoldorinan, Geleriand,\nBladorinand, Belaurien, Arsiriand, Lassiriand, Ossiriand.",

    "text": "The AWAKENING OF THE ELVES is an event which took place long before the\nbeginning of the First Age of Middle-earth.\n\nAccording to a legend of the Elves, the first Elves were awakened by Eru\nIlúvatar near the bay of Cuiviénen. The first Elf to awake was called\nIMIN (“First”). Next to him lay IMINYË, who would become his wife. Near\nwhere Imin woke, awoke TATA (“Second”) and TATIË, and ENEL (“Third”) and\nENELYË.\n\nImin, Tata, and Enel and their wives joined up and walked through the\nforests. They first came across six pairs of Elves, and Imin, as eldest,\nclaimed them as his people, and woke them. After a short time Imin and\nhis people, together with Tata and Enel, continued their journey. Next,\nthey came across nine pairs of Elves, and Tata as second eldest, claimed\nthem as his people. After a short time the now thirty-six Elves\ncontinued their journey. Then they found twelve pairs of Elves, and\nEnel, as third eldest, claimed them as his people.\n\nFor many days the now sixty Elves dwelt by the rivers, and they began to\ninvent poetry and music.\n\nFinally they set out again, but Imin thought to himself that since each\ntime they had found more Elves and his folk was least in size, he would\nnow choose last.\n\nThey came across eighteen pairs of Elves, who were watching the stars,\nand Tata and Enel waited for Imin to claim them for his people, but Imin\ntold them he would wait, so Tata added them to his folk. They were tall\nand had dark hair, and they were the fathers of most of the Ñoldor of\nlater times.\n\nThe ninety-six Elves now spoke with each other and invented many new\nwords, but then they continued their journey. Next they found\ntwenty-four pairs of Elves, who were singing without language, and again\nImin was offered the choice, but refused. Therefore Enel chose them as\nhis people, and from them came most of the Lindar or singers of later\ntimes.\n\nAnd the hundred and forty-four Elves now dwelt long together, until all\nhad learned the same language, and they were glad. But then Imin said it\nwas time to seek more companions for him, but most of the others were\ncontent and did not join him. So Imin and Iminyë and their twelve\ncompanions set out alone, and they searched long near Cuiviénen, but\nnever found any more companions.\n\nAnd because all Elves had been found in groups of twelve, twelve became\nthe number they counted with ever after, and 144 was for long their\nhighest number, and in none of their later tongues was there therefore\nany common name for a greater number.\n\nAfter the tale of the Awakening of the Elves the _Companions of Imin_ or\nthe Eldest Company (the later Vanyar) numbered fourteen, and they\nremained the smallest company. The _Companions of Tata_ (half of whom\nbecame the Ñoldor) numbered fifty-six, and they remained the\nsecond-largest company. The _Companions of Enel_ (the later Lindar or\nTeleri) were the largest company, numbering seventy-four.\n\nMelkor was the first to learn of the Awakening. He soon began sending\nevil spirits among the Elves, who planted seeds of doubt against the\nValar. It is also rumoured that some of the Elves were being captured by\na Rider if they strayed too far, and the Elves later believed these were\nbrought to Utumno and twisted into Orcs.\n\nOromë one day came across the Elves, and realized who they were. At\nfirst the Elves were suspicious of him, fearing he was the Rider who\ncaptured the Elves, and because of the lies of Melkor. Nevertheless,\nthree lords of the Elves agreed to come with Oromë to Valinor. These\nwere Ingwë of the _Minyar_ (later _Vanyar_), Finwë of the _Tatyar_\n(later _Ñoldor_), and Elwë of the _Lindar_. In due time, Ingwë, Finwë\nand Elwë returned to Cuivienen, and told the Elves of the glory of\nValinor, and there befell the Sundering of the Elves. All the Minyar and\nhalf of the Tatyar were persuaded, along with most of the Lindar, and\nfollowed Oromë into the west on the Great Journey. These have been known\never since by the name Eldar, or “Star-folk”, which Oromë gave to them\nin their own language. The remainder of the Tatyar and Lindar remained\nsuspicious, or simply refused to depart from their own lands, and spread\ngradually throughout the wide lands of Middle-earth. They were after\nknown by the name Avari, meaning 'the Unwilling', because they refused\nthe summons, in Quenya, the language of the Eldar that eventually\nreached Valinor.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe tale of Imin, Tata and Enel, known as _CUIVIENYARNA_, was a very\nlate writing by Tolkien, written as part of _Quendi and Eldar_. They\nreplaced Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë as the eldest Elves, who now merely\nbecame the first ambassadors and the Kings of the Elves in exile.\n\nit:Risveglio degli Elfi ru:Пробуждение эльфов",

    "text": "The TWO TREES OF VALINOR also known as the TREES OF THE VALAR,''' '''the\nTWO TREES: '''Laurelin '''(the Gold Tree) and '''Telperion '''(the\nSilver Tree), brought light into the Land of the Valar in ancient times.\nThey were destroyed by Melkor and Ungoliant, but their last flower and\nfruit were made by the Valar into the Sun and the Moon.\n\n\nCreation and destruction\n\nThe first sources of light for all of Arda were two enormous Lamps,\nIlluin, the silver one to the north, and Ormal, the golden one to the\nsouth. These were cast down and destroyed by Melkor. Afterward, the\nValar went to Valinor and Yavanna sang into existence the Two Trees,\nsilver Telperion and golden Laurelin. Telperion was considered male and\nLaurelin female. The Trees sat on the hill Ezellohar located outside\nValimar. They grew in the presence of all of the Valar, watered by the\ntears of Nienna.\n\n Each tree was a source of\nlight: Telperion's silver and Laurelin's gold. Telperion had dark leaves\n(silver on one side) and his silvery dew was collected as a source of\nwater and of light. Laurelin had gold-trimmed leaves and her dew was\nlikewise collected by Varda. One “day” lasted twelve hours. Each Tree,\nin turn, would give off light for seven hours (waxing to full brightness\nand then slowly waning again), so that at one hour each of “dawn” and\n“dusk” soft gold and silver light would be given off together.\n\nJealous, Melkor enlisted the help of the giant spider-creature Ungoliant\n(the mother of Shelob) to destroy the Two Trees. Concealed in Unlight,\nMelkor struck each Tree and the insatiable Ungoliant devoured whatever\nlife and light remained in them.\n\nAgain Yavanna sang and Nienna wept, but they succeeded only in reviving\nTelperion's last flower (to become the Moon) and Laurelin's last fruit\n(to become the Sun). These were assigned to lesser spirits, male Tilion\nand female Arien, after the 'genders' of the Trees themselves. This\nis why, in _The Lord of the Rings_, the Sun is usually referred to as\n“she” and the moon as “he”.\n\nHowever, the true light of the Trees, before their poisoning by\nUngoliant, was said to afterwards reside only in the Silmarils.\n\n\nTelperion's descendants\n\nBecause the Elves that first came to Valinor especially loved Telperion,\nYavanna made a second tree like it to stand in the city of Tirion where\nthe Vanyar and Ñoldor dwelt together at first. This tree,\nnamed Galathilion, was identical to Telperion except that it gave no\nlight of its own. It had many seedlings, one of which was planted in the\nisle of Tol Eressëa (named CELEBORN).\n\nIn the Second Age, a seedling of Celeborn was brought as a gift to the\nNúmenóreans - this was Nimloth, the White Tree of Númenor. It lasted\nthrough the majority of the realm's duration, but when Sauron took\ncontrol of the island he commanded King Ar-Pharazôn to chop it down.\n\nFortunately Isildur managed to save a single fruit of that tree. Of this\nfruit later came the White Tree of Gondor.\n\n\nInternal significance\n\nThe Two Trees of Valinor existed at a time when the only other source of\nlight was the stars (which had been created for the Elves' benefit by\nVarda from the dews collected from the Two Trees). When three Elven\nambassadors were brought to see Valinor for themselves, in order that\nthe Elves might be convinced to come to Valinor, it seems that the Two\nTrees affected them most significantly.\n\nIn particular Thingol is said to have been motivated in the Great\nJourney by his desire to see the Light of Valinor again (until he finds\ncontentment in the light he sees in Melian's face). Also in later times,\nthe Elves would be divided between the _CALAQUENDI_ who had seen the\nlight of the Trees, and the _MORIQUENDI_ who hadn't; with the former\ngroup having found enlightenment and near rapture in the light they\nbeheld.\n\nThe Silmarillion repeatedly states that those Elves who saw the Two\nTrees were mighty, with the light of Aman in their faces. As vassals of\nthe Valar, the trees somehow bestowed otherworldy power and\nunderstanding on those who were exposed to them. Galadriel in particular\nhad an affinity to Laurelin, as her hair was said to have captured the\ngolden light of that tree. In turn this inspired Feanor to make the\njewels that could hold that same light; the Silmarils.\n\nThe whole of the history of the First Age is strongly affected by the\ndesire of many different characters to possess the Silmarils, which\ncontain the only remaining unsullied light of the Trees. Yet upon his\nflight from Valinor after destroying the light of the Two Trees, Melkor\nstole the Silmarils and sparked the Oath of Fëanor (who renamed Melkor\nMorgoth) and after many years the Valar embarked on the War of Wrath,\nWhich ended the First Age\n\nIn the Second and Third Ages, the White Trees of Númenor and of Gondor,\nwhose likeness descends from that of Telperion, have a mostly symbolic\nsignificance. They stand both as symbols of the kingdoms in question,\nand also as reminders of the ancestral alliance between the Dúnedain and\nthe Elves. Even in this late age the two trees are remembered by some.\nGandalf obviously remembers them with reverence, as he speaks of them to\nPippin.\n\n\nExternal significance\n\nTolkien, as a Roman Catholic, would have been exposed to the\nsignificance of light in Catholic symbolism. Trees were of special\nimportance to him - in his short story _Leaf by Niggle_, which in a\nsense was an elaborate allegory explaining his own creative process, the\nprotagonist spends his life painting a single Tree.\n\nThe Two Trees represent the recurrent 'gold and silver' concept of the\nlegendarium. They are created after the lamps Ormal and Illuin - and\nfrom the trees themselves, the Sun and Moon are later created.\n\nTolkien may have also gotten inspiration for the trees directly from the\nSun, which rises in the day (as Laurelin, the golden tree), and the moon\nwhich rises in the night (Telperion, the silver tree).\n\n\nEtymology\n\nBoth Telperion and Laurelin are said to have been given many names among\nwhich are the following: Laurelin was also given the names of MALINALDA\nand CULÚRIEN,''' '''while Telperion was also named '''Silpion '''and\nNINQUELÓTË. Telperion's name in Valarin, the language of the Valar, is\nsaid to have been _IBRÎNIÐILPATHÂNEZEL_; Laurelin's name is recorded as\n_TULUKHEDELGORÛS._\n\nIn early writings of Tolkien, Telperion's names were SILPION ,\nBANSIL, and BELTHIL.\n\n\nQuotations\n\n“Yet even as hope failed  Telperion bore at last upon a leafless\nbough one great flower of silver, and Laurelin a single fruit of gold.”\n- _The Silmarillion_\n\n“... and perceive the unimaginable hand and mind of Feanor at their\nwork, while both the White Tree and Golden were in flower!” Gandalf to\nPippin, _The Two Towers_\n\n\nNotes\n\n-   Tolkien could have taken the creation of light mentioned in Genesis\n    as inspiration for the two trees, as both brought light into\n    Middle-earth and were turned into the moon and sun.",

    "text": "The self-named '''King's Men '''hailed from Númenor. They were\nNúmenóreans who rebelled against the angelic Valar because of their\ndesire for immortality. After Númenór was consequently destroyed, those\nKing's Men who remained were known as Black Númenóreans, hostile to\nGondor.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThough the King's Men had enjoyed generations of favor from the Kings of\nNúmenor, and no doubt helped in oppressing the Faithful as the Kings\ngrew more suspicious of them, eventually a supporter of the Faithful\ntook the Sceptre once again. This King's name was Tar-Palantir. He\nwished to return Númenor to a state of friendship with the West, but the\nmajority of the Númenóreans still clung to the policies of the King's\nMen. Tar-Palantir's younger brother, Gimilkhâd, sided with his\nrebellious fathers, however. He took up the leadership of the King's Men\nand stood in opposition to his brother, but generally kept his doings\nsecret.\n\nIt was probably to a few lords of the King's Men that Sauron came to\ndeliver some of the Nine Rings of Power, for three of the Nazgûl were\nsaid to be “lords of Númenórean race”. Most of the King's Men living in\nMiddle-earth Sauron and his servants assailed, however. Eventually, the\nlast King of Númenor, Ar-Pharazôn the son of Gimilkhâd, resolved to\ndefeat Sauron in retaliation for this aggression, and he and his men\nsailed to Middle-earth and captured the Maia.\n\nOnce in Númenor, Sauron completed the corruption of the King's Men with\nease, inciting them to worship Melkor and use the few Faithful still\nliving in the land as sacrifices. They also brutally oppressed the Men\nof Middle-earth during this period. The corrupting power of Sauron\naffected their minds deeply, so that they became “quick to anger”, and\nhated all those in the land more fortunate than them. Nor did they\nescape death, for all sorts of sicknesses and mental afflictions\nassailed them, to the point that they “cursed themselves in their\nagony”. When the Valar sent messages of warning in the form of\neagle-shaped clouds to them, they fell upon their faces in great fear,\nand some repented of their actions for a while. In the end, however,\nSauron's mastery over them was so complete that he could walk about the\nland “setting man against man”, and cause them to slay each other. At\nlast, when Ar-Pharazôn had grown old and was in great fear of death,\nSauron persuaded him to take a great army to Aman and challenge the\nValar for immortality. When he did this, his army foundered in the Sea\nand Númenor was also destroyed. Most of the King's Men thus perished\nin the destruction of Ar-Pharazôn's fleet and the Downfall of Númenor,\nbut those who had taken up residence in Middle-earth survived. When\nSauron returned to Mordor, they entered into his service once again, and\nbecame known as the Black Númenóreans.\n\n\nAfter the Downfall\n\n  For many centuries after\nthe Downfall, these descendants of the King's Men held onto the Haven of\nUmbar, the most northerly and famous of their realms.\n\nWhen the surviving Faithful Numenoreans founded Gondor and Arnor, they\nsaw their southern counterparts as renegades, calling them the Black\nNúmenóreans. The Black Númenóreans held a similar hatred of Arnor and\nGondor for generations.\n\nTwo early Black Númenórean lords from the late Second Age were Herumor\nand Fuinur who desired power over men of other, lesser races, and they\n“rose to (great) power amongst the Haradrim”, the peoples neighbouring\nUmbar. They likely shared Sauron's defeat at the hands of the Last\nAlliance of Elves and Men.\n\nThe triumph of the Last Alliance marked the decline of the Black\nNúmenórean race and the end of their racial superiority. They dwindled\nswiftly or became merged with the Middle Men.\n\nQueen Berúthiel, wife of Gondor's King Tarannon Falastur was “a black\nNúmenórean”. This was a loveless union, and was presumably a\npolitical accommodation: that such arrangements were possible implies\nthe existence at that time of more Gondor-friendly Black Númenóreans\nthan the much later Mouth of Sauron.  A\nBlack Númenórean elite survived at least in Umbar for over a thousand\nyears after Númenor's fall, maintaining much influence in Haradwaith. As\nlate as Third Age 1015, for example, even after being exiled from their\nhomeland for nearly a century, the lords that had been driven from Umbar\nled the Haradrim to retake Umbar.\n\nNot much is known about the Black Númenóreans after their defeat by\nCiryaher in T.A. 1050. A “Renegade”, The Mouth of Sauron, had entered\nthe service of Sauron in Mordor. He mocked the army of King Elessar in\nfront of the Morannon.\n\nBlack Numenorean by Jan Pospisil.png Imgres-3.jpeg Ten Cats of Queen\nBeruthiel by Steamey.jpg Black Númenóreans doing a ritual.JPG The Mouth\nof Sauron.jpg The Lord of the Rings War in the North - Men of Carn\nDûm.jpg\n\n\nPolicies\n\nBecause the Shadow lay heavy upon their hearts, the King's Men greatly\nfeared Death and “sought to delay it by all means that they could”.\nThese attempts to escape their fate actually brought death upon them\nsooner, and the lifespans of their Kings waned. They filled the land of\nNúmenor with great tombs to preserve the memory of their dead. In the\nmeantime, their everyday lives became ever more decadent: to ease their\nfears, they “drank and they feasted and they clad themselves in silver\nand gold”.",

The finest of these pieces was the Nauglamír.\n\nThe Nauglamír was the second-greatest treasure of Doriath, prized above\nall but Beren and Lúthien's Silmaril. After the smiths of Belegost\nfinished their work on the Nauglamír, Thingol requested that the Dwarves\nof Nogrod set the Silmaril in it. The Nauglamír, now bearing the\nSilmaril was held to be the fairest object in Arda.\n\nEnthralled by its beauty and greedy for the Silmaril, the dwarves\ndemanded the necklace insisting that as dwarf work it belonged to them.\nThingol was unwilling to surrender the treasure and replies with an\nimpertinent answer. In their anger, the Dwarves slew him. Two escaped to\nNogrod and told a much different story to their kinsmen, persuading the\ncity to march on Doriath.\n\nAfter the Fall of Doriath, the Dwarves of Nogrod marched homewards with\nthe stolen Nauglamír and the rest of the treasures of that land but\nBeren, at the head of an army of Laiquendi and Ents slew the dwarves.\nThe treasure was cast into the Ascar save the Nauglamír, which Beren\ngave to Lúthien.\n\nAfter Beren and Lúthien's final deaths, the necklace was inherited by\ntheir son, Dior, who became the second King of Doriath. When the Sons of\nFëanor heard that the inheritor of the throne of Doriath, they demanded\nthat he surrender it to them or become their enemy. When he refused,\nthis brought about the Second Kinslaying as the Sons of Fëanor, seeking\nthe Silmaril in accordance with the Oath of Fëanor, attacked Doriath.\nDior's daughter, Elwing, escaped the kinslaying with the Nauglamír,\nfleeing to the Mouths of Sirion.\n\nIn the Third Kinslaying, the Sons of Fëanor attacked the Elven havens in\nthe Mouths of Sirion, still trying to obtain the Silmaril within the\nNauglamír but Elwing cast herself into the sea with it rather than\nsurrender the gem to Maedhros and Maglor. The Nauglamír was lost, while\nElwing and the Silmaril were saved by the Vala Ulmo.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn an earlier myth of First Age lore that preceded the final stories in\n_The Silmarillion_, namely the Lost Tale _The Nauglafring_, the\nNauglamír (named the NAUGLAFRING) is more important: the necklace\nbecomes caught behind a tree branch when Thingol is riding outside the\nGirdle of Melian and is attacked by the Dwarves. Thingol is unhorsed and\nslain. Following this, Melian's protection is lifted and Doriath is\nsacked.",

On its\npeak stood Durin's Tower. It was one of the three Mountains of Moria,\nalong with Caradhras and the Fanuidhol, under which lay the ancient\nDwarf realm of Khazad-dûm.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Dwarves called the mountain-summit Zirakzigil. In ancient times,\nthey built the Endless Stair - a spiral staircase of many thousand steps\n- from the roots of the mountain up to its peak. On an eyrie atop the\nmountain they built Durin's Tower. By the end of the Third Age, the\nstair and the tower were remembered only in legend.\n\nThen, on January 23, 3019, Gandalf and the Balrog climbed the Endless\nStair to the summit of the Silvertine. There they fought the Battle of\nthe Peak, which lasted three days. During the battle, Durin's Tower was\ndestroyed and the stairs were blocked. The Balrog of Moria was finally\ndestroyed. Gandalf the Grey died and was soon returned to life as\nGandalf the White. Gandalf was rescued from the Silvertine by Gwaihir\nthe Windlord on February 17, 3019.\n\n\n\n\nEtymology\n\nA _tine_ is a point or prong. _Celebdil_ is derived from _celeb_ meaning\n“silver” and _til_ (modified to -_dil)_ meaning “horn,” or\n“point.” The translation of ''Zirakzigil ''is most likely “silver\nspike,” but it is not clear which element means “silver” and which means\n“spike.” A note written by J.R.R. Tolkien proposed that _zirak_ meant\n“silver” and _zigil_ meant “spike” but a later note said the reverse -\nthat _zigil_ meant “silver” and _zirak_ meant “spike.”",

    "text": "The MALLORN (pl. _MELLYRN_) was a kind of large tree that throughout\nhistory only grew in Aman, Númenor, Lindon, and Lórien in the Eastern\nlands of Middle-earth.\n\n\nDescription\n\nMellyrn were similar to beech trees in that their bark was smooth and\nsilver-grey, but their leaves, which were green above and silver\nbeneath, were much larger and longer than beech trees, and turned a\nclear gold in autumn. The golden leaves did not fall like other\ndeciduous trees, but remained on the tree throughout the winter, only\nfalling in the spring, when golden flowers bloomed on the branches and\nnew leaves sprouted, turning the entire forest a bright gold. There is\nthe sense that mallorn trees were more alive or had a greater presence\nthan other trees. Frodo Baggins explained that he could feel the “life\nof the tree” when he touched a mallorn in Lothlórien.\n\n\nHistory\n\nMallorn-trees originally grew on Tol Eressëa, and probably also grew in\nValinor. The Ñoldor may have introduced mellyrn to Gondolin when they\ncame to Middle-earth, but these were all destroyed with the city. The\nElves of Tol Eressëa brought mallorn-trees to the Men of Númenor and\nthey grew on the shores around the Bay of Eldanna in that land. Even\nTar-Aldarion, the great Ship-King, did not cut down these trees.\n\nMellorn-nuts were once given by Tar-Aldarion, a Ship-King of Númenor, to\nhis friend Gil-galad, the Ñoldorin King of Lindon. The mellyrn did not\ngrow in Lindon, but Galadriel took some nuts with her to Lothlórien,\nwhere they grew to immense heights. Lothlórien became known as the\n_Golden Wood_, per its name's translation, because of them.\n\nThe Fellowship spent its first night in Lothlorien on flets (wooden\nplatforms) built onto the upper branches of several adjacent mallorn\ntrees. In this case the flets were of simple construction with light\nwoven movable walls to block the wind. These mallorn trees were on the\nNorth Eastern edge of Lothlorien, close by the tributary river of\nNimrodel or Silverlode.\n\nCaras Galadhon, the city of Galadriel and Celeborn within Lothlórien,\nwas built in the branches of huge mallorn-trees, with a large hall built\ninto the upper branches of the tallest tree at the centre of the city.\nThe large horizontal branches of the mallorn lent themselves to being\nused in this way. The Fellowship were later given lembas the elvish\nwaybread wrapped in mallorn-leaves. The mallorn leaf wrapping helped\nkeep the waybread fresh and helped sustain its capacity to keep people\nalive for long periods in the absence of other foods.\n\nGaladriel gave Samwise Gamgee a box of soil from her garden containing a\nsingle silver mallorn nut. After the War of the Ring, Sam planted the\nnut in the Shire, in the Party Field where the Party Tree had stood.\nFrom the nut grew a new Mallorn-tree that became the new party tree. It\nwas the only mallorn-tree in Middle-earth outside of Lórien. When the\ntree bloomed the next spring and summer it became the wonder of the\nneighbourhood and in time a place of pilgrimage; an image of times long\npast and a thing of beauty and wonder. . Symbolically, this specific\ntree acts as the living sign of the special blessing and thanks which\nthe Shire receives for the efforts of Frodo, Samwise, Meriadoc and\nPeregrin in the struggle against Sauron and Saruman; as well as a nod to\nthe essential and simple good qualities of the hobbit people and their\nclose relationship to their lands.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name is derived from the Sindarin terms _malt_ (“gold”) and _orn_\n(“tree”).\n\nMALINORNË is the Quenya name for Mallorn.",

The hill was long\nand sloping and the wood went almost to the summit.\n\nWhile it was considered the centre of Gondor, it would be better\ndescribed as the spiritual centre of Gondor, as it was _the high place\nnearest to the centre of a line from the inflow of the Limlight down to\nthe southern cape of Tolfalas and the distance to it was equal from the\nFords of Isen and Minas Tirith_.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Tomb of Elendil\n\nAfter the War of the Last Alliance, Isildur defined the bounds of Gondor\nand, upon discovering that this was the centre of Gondor, he entombed\nhis father Elendil here and it was at this time that the hill's name\nbecame AMON ANWAR, as Isildur had called the protection of the Valar\nupon that hilltop, and they had granted it. Isildur swore all those\npresent to secrecy and forbade anyone save an Heir of Elendil from\ndisturbing it. The tomb then stayed untouched by any save the Kings of\nGondor and later, their Stewards.\n\nThe Oath of Eorl\n\nIn the time of the twelfth Ruling Steward, Cirion, Gondor was faced with\na massive invasion of a land they could not protect, Calenardhon which\nhad been depopulated in the Great Plague of 1636, though it had not been\ngreatly populated to begin with. Cirion called upon the aid of the\nÉothéod and in return for their aid, he surrendered Calenardhon to them,\nUntil the Great King should return. Although by this time the lives of\neleven Stewards had passed before him, no one in Gondor ever expected\nthat the King would return.\n\nCirion took Eorl, the Lord of the Éothéod to the hallowed site of AMON\nANWAR and there before the Tomb of Elendil they swore what would be in\nlater days known as the Oath of Eorl, giving Calenardhon to the Éothéod,\nand promising eternal friendship between the two Kingdoms. As Amon Anwar\nwas no longer the centre of Gondor, rather its border, Cirion removed\nthe Casket that Isildur had set upon the hill two thousand years earlier\nto Rath Dínen, the Silent Street, where all other Kings of Gondor were\nentombed.\n\nThe Warning Beacon\n\nAmon Anwar was the seventh and last of the Warning beacons of Gondor\nwhich gave the final warning or message to Rohan. It stood overlooking\nthe Firien wood which was just outside the border of Rohan near the\nMering Stream. Also, chain of Warning Beacons was established along the\nline of the White Mountains to warn South Gondor of danger in\nCalenardhon, and vice-versa. Later this was used to warn Anorien of\nDanger to Gondor and Rohan also. The westernmost and last built beacon\nwas situated upon AMON ANWAR, and was only created after the Tomb of\nElendil was removed to Rath Dínen, as no Lord of Gondor, King or steward\nhad permitted the construction of a beacon whilst Elendil still remained\nthere.\n\nEven after Elendil was removed to Minas Tirith, the Awe still remained\nupon the hill, and its surrounding forest. The Beacon Wardens would live\nclose to the Summit only for short watches in specially constructed\ncabins. Except when there was a noise of animals in the forest, or of\nfolk along the road, they would find themselves speaking to their\ncompanions in whispers, as if they expected a great voice from long ago\nto speak. The Wardens were the only people to live in those woods, and\nwere glad when their tour of duty was over. The mound of Elendil's Tomb\nremained upon the top of the hill from the time that Isildur hallowed it\nuntil the Changing of the world, always in a well-kept, green field.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_AMON ANWAR_ was Sindarin for 'Hill of Awe'.",

The Tower of Ecthelion was used to bear the plain white\nstandard of the Stewards of Gondor of the City, which flew from its\npinnacle, and—at least during the last years of the Third Age. It is 50\nfathoms (300 feet) tall. The Tower stood in the center of the Citadel on\nthe seventh level of the city. In front of the Tower was the Place of\nthe Fountain where the White Tree of Gondor grew.\n\nIn the Tower Hall was the throne of the King of Gondor upon a dais, and\nat the foot the dais on the lowest step was a black chair where the\nSteward of Gondor would sit. There was a chamber high in the Tower and\nabove it in the summit there was a secret room where the Palantír of\nMinas Anor, called the _Anor-stone_, was kept.\n\nBelow the Hall was the buttery of Beregond's company, where the Citadel\nGuard (which Pippin became) would stay when not on duty.\n\n\nHistory\n\nKing Calimehtar first built the White Tower in TA 1900 in order to house\nthe Palantír. In TA 2698, the Tower was repaired and rebuilt by the\nSteward Ecthelion I, some three centuries before the War of the Ring,\nand for whom the Tower came to be named.\n\nThe elite military unit in Minas Tirith was called the Guard of the\nCitadel or the Guard of the Tower. At the time of the War of the Ring,\nBoromir and Faramir - the sons of the Steward of Gondor - each bore the\ntitle Captain of the White Tower. Boromir, the Steward's heir, was also\nthe High Warden of the White Tower.\n\nOn March 9, 3019, Peregrin Took got his first glimpse of the Tower of\nEcthelion as he rode with Gandalf to Minas Tirith:\n\n_Then Pippin cried aloud, for the Tower of Ecthelion, standing high\nwithin the topmost wall, shone out against the sky, glimmering like a\nspike of pearl and silver, tall and fair and shapely, and its pinnacle\nglittered as if it were wrought of crystals; and white banners broke and\nfluttered from the battlements in the morning breeze, and high and far\nhe heard a clear ringing as of silver trumpets._\n\n-The Return of the King: chapter 1,“Minas Tirith”\n\nPippin met Denethor II, the Steward of Gondor, in the Tower Hall.\nDenethor's son Faramir came to the Tower Hall the next day, and Pippin\nand Gandalf learned of his encounter with Frodo and Sam in Ithilien.\nWhen Faramir was brought back to the city gravely wounded on March 13,\nDenethor retreated to his chamber high in the Tower with his son and\nwould not come down. In the secret chamber of the Tower, Denethor looked\ninto the _Palantír_ and saw images manipulated by Sauron that caused him\nto despair.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring on May 1, 3019, the standard of the Stewards\nof Gondor was raised for the last time. That day Aragorn was crowned\nKing and when he entered the Citadel; the standard of the Kings of\nGondor bearing the White Tree and the Stars was unfurled on the pinnacle\nof the Tower of Ecthelion.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIt was renamed the _Tower of Ecthelion_ after the Steward Ecthelion I\nwho rebuilt it.

The famous Took family\nlived in the Great Smials, their ancestral home, and many-tunneled\nmansion.\n\nDuring the Scouring of the Shire, many Hobbit-holes were destroyed and\nreplaced with wooden shacks, towards the end of the Third Age.\n\nde:Smials",

Elrond and the others agreed that this was indeed the One Ring,\nbased on evidence provided by Gandalf.\n\nGandalf related his meeting with Saruman and subsequent imprisonment by\nthe traitor in Orthanc.\n\nBoromir described the dream he and his brother Faramir had experienced,\nand which led him to come to Rivendell. He pleaded that the Ring should\nbe used to aid Gondor in her struggle against Mordor, but was told that\nit would inevitably corrupt anyone who used it. Only a mighty person\ncould hope to wield the Ring against Sauron, and they would in time\nbecome a new Dark Lord whether they wished it or not. Boromir\nreluctantly accepted this conclusion.\n\nGlóin, Gimli's father, spoke of evil messengers who had come to the\nLonely Mountain promising the return of one or more of the Seven rings\nif they would reveal the location of Bilbo Baggins. The possibility of\nwar with Sauron's allies in the region was troubling, but Gandalf was\nrelieved that at least Smaug the dragon was no longer around for the\nDark Lord to use. They had also came seeking news of what happened to\nBalin, who went to Moria in TA 2989 with Ori and Óin.\n\n\n\nLegolas conveyed the bad news that Gollum had escaped captivity and\ndisappeared. Aragorn had gone to great lengths to capture the debased\ncreature, who had possessed the Ring for centuries under the Misty\nMountains. After his capture, Aragorn and Gandalf had interrogated the\nmiserable Gollum, and found to their dismay that he had been to Mordor.\nApparently, while under torment there, Gollum had confessed both that he\nhad held the One Ring and that Bilbo had taken it to the Shire.\n\nAfter much debate about the fate of the Ring, it was decided that the\nonly way to be free of Sauron's evil was to cast the Ring into the\nCracks of Doom in Mount Doom (in Mordor), where it would be unmade. This\nmight well undo the power of the three Elf-rings, but would certainly\nrender Sauron impotent and free Middle-earth from his menace forever.\n\nTom Bombadil was also mentioned as a possible ring bearer since the ring\ntook no effect on him, but Gandalf stated that Tom would most likely\nlose it as Tom seemed to be very nonchalant about the War of the Ring.\n\nIt then became necessary to decide who should take responsibility for\nsuch a perilous undertaking. Bilbo offered to finish the job he had\nstarted, but Gandalf told him he could not take back the Ring. Frodo\nsurprised everyone (including himself) by announcing that he would take\nthe Ring, and after some thought Elrond agreed. At this point Sam\nemerged from hiding and demanded to accompany Frodo, and since it was\nhardly possible to separate them Elrond agreed.\n\nThe matter of who else should accompany Frodo (later to be known as the\nFellowship of the Ring, hence the title of the book and subsequent\nmovie) was decided later, although the movie version of _The Fellowship\nof the Ring_ depicts the choosing of the Fellowship as taking place at\nthe end of the Council, and has Merry and Pippin also eavesdropping on\nthe proceedings and demanding to accompany Frodo.\n\n\nPresent individuals\n\nThose present at the Council had arrived at Rivendell by different paths\nand on separate errands, yet they were all ultimately concerned with the\nRing and its effect upon the people of Middle-earth. Important\nparticipants at the Council were:\n\n-   Elrond - a Half-elven conveyor, member of White Council and lord of\n    Rivendell.\n-   Erestor - an Elf-lord, advisor, and the chief of the House of\n    Elrond.\n-   Gandalf the Grey - a Wizard, one of the Istari, and member of both\n    the White Council and The Fellowship.\n-   Aragorn - a Ranger, heir of Isildur, member of The Fellowship, and\n    Chieftain of the Dúnedain in the North.\n-   Frodo Baggins - a Hobbit of the Shire, member of The Fellowship, and\n    Ring-bearer.\n-   Bilbo Baggins - a Hobbit of the Shire, former Ring-bearer, uncle of\n    Frodo and long resident in Rivendell.\n-   Boromir of Gondor - son of Denethor II Ruling Steward of Minas\n    Tirith, and member of The Fellowship.\n-   Glóin of the Lonely Mountain - representative of the King under the\n    Mountain, Dain Ironfoot of the Dwarves.\n-   Gimli - son of Gloin, member of The Fellowship, and dwarf of the\n    Lonely Mountain.\n-   Legolas - a Sindar Elf of the Woodland Realm (Mirkwood), son of\n    Thranduil the Elvenking, and member of The Fellowship.\n-   Glorfindel - an Elf-lord of Rivendell, rescuer of Frodo and his\n    company from the Nine.\n-   Galdor of the Havens - messenger from Círdan of the Grey Havens.",

    "text": "The WOODLAND REALM, later known as MIRKWOOD, was a kingdom of Silvan\nElves located deep in the Forest of the Wilderland beginning in the\nSecond Age. King Thranduil of the Sindar rules over the Silvan Elves.\nThe Elves of the Woodland Realm, unlike many Elves, were known to be\nless wise and more dangerous, but were nevertheless one of the most\npowerful and legendary of the Elves of Middle-earth.\n\nLegolas, a key member of the Fellowship of the Ring in the Third Age,\nhailed from here.\n\n\nHistory\n\nEarly\n\nDuring the latter half of the Years of the Trees and the First Age, the\nNandorin and Avarin Elves populated the forest between the Misty\nMountains and the Far East lands, mixing themselves together becoming\nSilvan Elves or Wood-elves. It is not known how they lived but it is\npossible they lived in small tribal groups wandering the forest.\n\nSecond Age\n\nAfter the War of Wrath and the destruction of the Beleriand, Oropher, a\nSindarin prince formerly of Doriath who chose to stay in Middle-earth,\ncame to the forest known as Greenwood the Great. He and his company were\nwell received and well accepted as they had once lived with King\nThingol, whom they regarded as distant kin. The Sindarin company\nintended to live like the Wood-elves: natural and undisturbed. This\nnotion was appealing to the Wood-elves and Oropher was soon named their\nking, adopting their language and way of life.\n\nAfter being named King of the Woodland Realm, Oropher established his\ncapital on Amon Lanc in the southern part of the forest. The Woodland\nrealm flourished in peace with its boundaries unchanged and way of life\nundisturbed for over a millennium. Sometime after SA 1000, Oropher had\nhis capital moved further north in around the Mountains of Mirkwood. The\nmain reason for this was the growing threat of Sauron in the East.\nOropher and his people also felt threatened by the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm\nand by the presence of Celeborn and Galadriel in the forest. Despite\nthese problems, the Elves of the Woodland Realm still continued to roam\nthe south of the forest westward down the Anduin.\n\nOver one hundred years after the Downfall of Númenor, the threat of\nSauron once again grew into a very real threat to Middle-earth. Oropher\nand the Elves of Lórien under Amdír both agreed that peace could not be\nresorted until Sauron was completely defeated. A large army was created\nand a combined force of Wood-elves and Galadhrim marched to support the\nLast Alliance of Elves and Men. Though they were as determined to defeat\nSauron as the others, Oropher and Amdír's army was lightly armed and\nless experienced in major warfare. They also refused to submit to the\nsupreme authority of Gil-galad due to past disputes with Ñoldor, and so\nfought independently. They suffered heavy losses and Oropher and Amdír\nwere both killed. Oropher's son survived the war and took his father's\nplace as King of the Woodland Realm.\n\nThird Age\n\nDespite the heavy losses their people had suffered during the War of the\nLast Alliance, the Elves of the Woodland Realm survived and continued\nliving peacefully in the forest for the next millennium. The peace was\nbroken in TA 1050 when a mysterious being known as the Necromancer began\nliving in the abandoned halls of Amon Lanc. Afterwards, the forest\nbecame dark and tainted, infested with Orcs, Great Spiders, and other\nmysterious and savage beings. The elves were then forced to remove\nthemselves to the northernmost part of the forest. All settlements in\nthe Mountains of Mirkwood were withdrawn and the capital and realm's\npeople relocated to a cave settlement under a wooded hill, in the\nnortheastern border of the forest. From then on, the Woodland Realm\nremained confined to the north. It was at this time that the Elves\nrenamed the forest to Mirkwood along other with other places they\nformerly occupied.\n\nThe Elves of the Woodland Realm survived but lived more cautiously\nconsidering the increased danger. They traded with the neighboring\nrealms of the Lonely Mountain and Dale. This however was not to last as\nthe Elves, Rhovanion and much of Middle-earth was affected by bad\nweather culminating in the Long Winter of TA 2758 and TA 2759 and the\nFell Winter of TA 2911 - TA 2912, during which extreme cold and large\nblankets of snow plagued the lands. However, the most devastating blow\nto the Woodland Realm until the War of the Ring came in TA 2770 when the\ndragon Smaug came down from the North and destroyed both the Dwarves of\nthe Lonely Mountain and the Mannish town of Dale. Afterwards, the elves\nmoved about the forest in secret and were very distrustful of any\nstrangers and their only contact with the outside world was trade and\noccasional visitation with the refugees of Dale living in Laketown on\nthe Long Lake. It was probably during this time that the Elves made the\nForest Path which ran across the northern forest as the only safe\npassage, as the main road that ran through was no longer safe.\n\nIn TA 2941, Thorin and Company came through the Woodland Realm on their\nway to the Lonely Mountain on The Quest of Erebor. Thranduil considered\nthem trespassers and had them imprisoned save for Bilbo, who remained\ninvisible with the use of his Magic Ring, who later released them.\nAfter the death of Smaug, Thranduil offered relief to the Men of\nLaketown for Bard’s valiant slaying of the dragon and assembled an army\nto claim part of the treasure, but Thorin refused to share it and so\nboth parties prepared for war. Bilbo tried to help the situation by\ndelivering the ancient artifact known as the Arkenstone to the Elves and\nMen.\n\nThe situation did not improve and with arrival of a Dwarven army of\nfive-hundred under Dáin II Ironfoot, and it seemed as if the Elves and\nMen would fight the Dwarves, but the timely arrival of Gandalf with a\nwarning of an army of Goblins and Wargs coming to do battle for the\ntreasure changed everything. The Elves, Men, and Dwarves were forced to\njoin forces and fight a common enemy. The Wood-elves and their allies,\nincluding the late-arriving Eagles, defeated the orcs and many lay dead,\nbut peace finally returned to the region with the Orcs defeated and news\nof the White Council having driven the Necromancer out of Dol Guldur.\n\nPeace for the Elves of the Woodland Realm reigned for decades until Dol\nGuldur once again was inhabited by evil creatures and Mordor grew in\npower and influence. The Woodland Realm became involved directly in the\nWar of the Ring when the creature Gollum was captured by Aragorn and\nimprisoned there, but an orc raid allowed him to escape. Afterwards,\nThranduil sent his son Legolas to Rivendell as a representative of the\nWoodland Realm and to inform the Council of Gollum’s escape.\n\nThe Woodland Realm was attacked on March 15, 3019 by forces from Dol\nGuldur, becoming part of the Battles of the North. Thranduil and the\nWood-elves were victorious and the forest was eventually cleansed of all\nits enemies and as Galadriel had thrown down the walls Dol Guldur, there\nwas no longer any threat from there and the shadow was permanently\nremoved from the forest. On April 6, 3019, Thranduil met with Celeborn\nand both agreed to rename the forest Eryn Lasgalen (Wood of\nGreenleaves). Soon after the war, the forest was divided with Thranduil\nleft to rule most of the northern part.\n\nFourth Age\n\nThe Woodland Realm people played an important role during the early\nyears when a group of Elves from the Woodland Realm led by Legolas\ntraveled to Gondor and helped rebuild the city of Minas Tirith and\nreplenished and beautified the war-ravaged lands of Ithilien. It is\npresumed that the realm prospered but like the other non-mannish realms\nit most likely became isolated and unto itself. Its fate is unknown but\nas some Elves left Middle-earth during the Fourth Age and the dominion\nof Man was at hand, the Wood-elves of the Woodland Realm may have\neventually become hidden and ultimately invisible to the eyes of Men.",

    "page_id": "9381",
    "text": "THE FAITHFUL, also known as ELENDILI or ELF-FRIENDS, referred to the\nminority faction of Númenóreans who remained friendly with the Elves and\nrespectful and obedient to the Valar. Their most noted leader was\nElendil, the Lord of Andúnië, who later founded the kingdoms of Arnor\nand Gondor in Middle-earth.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Faithful emerged as a result of the divisions that occurred by the\nclose of the Second Age. The Númenóreans had become split between the\nElendili and the King's Men, a faction centered around the King that\nsought to assert Númenórean authority and self-determination. With\nNúmenor reaching the apex of its might, the King's Men eventually\nespoused open defiance of the Valar. This split would eventually\nprecipitate the Fall of Númenor.\n\nThe Elendili, however, not only preserved their ancient friendship with\nthe Elves, they also regarded the burgeoning arrogance of the King's Men\nas blasphemy, but the King's Men became more powerful, and by the end of\nthe Second Age had begun to persecute the Elendili as rebels and\ndissidents. Fearing their growing strength, the King's men secured the\nFaithful's deportation from their strongholds in the western regions,\nnotably around the city Andúnië.\n\nThe seeds of the Faithful were sown in the days of Tar-Minastir and\nTar-Ciryatan; the group arose in the early twenty-third century of the\nSecond Age during the days of Tar-Ancalimon with Andúnië as their chief\ncity where the Elves were received with love. As use of Elven-tongues\nand respect for the Valar began to wane, the Faithful became the only\nones to preserve these traditions unto themselves. In SA 2350 seeing the\ncoming shadow, the Faithful founded the haven of Pelargir on the shores\nof Middle-earth as opposed to Umbar which became a haven of the King's\nMen. As the King's Men's influence grew and the people and their rulers\nbecame more and more greedy of wealth and power, there arose Ar-Gimilzôr\nin SA 3102. Being one of the King's Men, he openly persecuted the\nFaithful, forbidding the teaching and speaking of the Elven tongues nor\nwas meeting with Elves permitted either. The Faithful were then forced\nto move from the west havens to Rómenna where they were carefully\nwatched. In these evil days, many of the Faithful emigrated to the\nfriendly havens in Middle-earth.\n\nSome relief came to them in SA 3177, when Elf-friend Tar-Palantir\nassumed kingship and began to turn Númenor back to the ways of the\nFaithful. He repented the ways of his forefathers, stopped the\npersecution of the Faithful, and tried to amend the corruption of\nNúmenor but his line failed and the King's Men survived. Tar-Palantir's\nnephew Ar-Pharazôn, son of Gimilkhâd forcibly usurped the throne and the\nElendili were more vigorously oppressed. He defeated Sauron, the Dark\nLord and took him prisoner to Númenor. It was not long before the King\nlistened to his evil words and took him deep into his councils, Sauron\nplaying off his fear of death. This time with the help of the Dark Lord\nSauron, who had established an evil cult on the island to corrupt and\neventually destroy Númenórean society.\n\n\n\nIt was during these dark times that the Faithful endured their most\ngrievous woe for the King. During this time the Faithful were hunted,\nkilled and even sacrificed in Sauron's temple to the cult of Melkor.\nWhen the King prepared the Great Armament, Amandil, the current leader\nof the Faithful attempted to sail to Aman to beg for forgiveness and\nmercy from the Valar. Before doing so, he entrusted his son with the\ntask of preparing a fleet of ships to depart to Middle-earth to escape\nthe coming darkness. As Ar-Pharazôn led his grand armada to Aman to\nchallenge the Ban of the Valar, Elendil and the remaining, Elf-friends\nwere warned by the divine powers to leave Númenor forever. They were\nthus spared the downfall of Númenor when, as punishment for an attempt\nto defy the Ban, Eru Ilúvatar sank the island kingdom into the\nsea.\n\nWhen Númenor was destroyed in SA 3319, the fleet reached the shores of\nMiddle-earth founding the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor in a lineage of\nnobility leading up to King Elessar. The Elendili, under the leadership\nof Elendil and his sons, eventually made their way to refuge in\nMiddle-Earth where they were welcomed by the Elves.",

Interested in the making of crafts and\njewels, they drew close to the Dwarves of Moria and worked with in them\nin an alliance of friendship and peaceful commerce. Only Feanor\nsurpassed this group in cunning for things wrought. Celebrimbor was the\nmost skilled of this group. Their chief city was Ost-in-Edhil which\nstood in ruins for ages to come. For hundreds of years they prospered\nand grew immensely wealthy, but Sauron ever hungry for dominion over\nMiddle-earth was jealous of their power. He approached them in SA 1200\ndisguised as Annatar (The Lord of Gifts) and the Noldor, ever eager for\nmore knowledge, accepted his gifts and instruction. They also followed\nhim because although they loved Middle-Earth they wanted to have the\nBliss of Valinor. They could do this with the skills they would learn\nfrom him and make the land of their exile as beautiful as Eressea. With\nthis new Knowledge, they forged the Rings of Power with the help of\nSauron although Celebrimbor alone forged Three Rings and Sauron's hand\nnever touched these. However, in SA 1590 the smiths found themselves\nbetrayed and deceived when Celebrimbor discovered that Sauron forged the\nOne Ring to rule all the others. They then took of their rings and hid\nthem with the resulting wrath of Sauron. He demanded their return and\nsoon declared war on them and in SA 1695. By SA 1697 Eregion was\ndestroyed and Celebrimbor was slain along with many of his Jewel-smiths.\nSome of the Gwaith-i-Mírdain were evacuated to Rivendell with the help\nof Elrond.

It was an ancient defense against\nany enemy who might get past the Dimrill Gate (the east gate) and\ncapture the First Hall and the outer passages; walkers on the bridge\ncould only cross it single file, including any enemies.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOn January 15, 3019, the Fellowship came to the Bridge of Khazad-dûm\npursued by Orcs and a Balrog of Morgoth. Gandalf stopped on the Bridge,\nstanding in the middle of the span, allowing the others to escape. He\nleaned on the staff in his left hand and held the sword Glamdring,\ngleaming cold and white, in his right. The Balrog stepped onto the\nBridge, facing Gandalf, and the shadow about it reached out like two\nvast wings. It raised its whip, and the thongs whined and cracked. Fire\ncame from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm and declared that the\nBalrog could not pass. They fought, and the Balrog's sword was\ndestroyed. Then the Balrog leaped full upon the Bridge, and Gandalf\nlifted his staff and smote it upon the bridge. His staff shattered, but\nthe Bridge cracked at the Balrog's feet. The stone beneath the Balrog\nbroke and fell, taking the Balrog with it into the abyss, but the thongs\nof its whip snared Gandalf about his knees, and Wizard and Balrog\nplummeted together into the depths of the mountain. Gandalf cried, “Fly,\nyou fools!” and was gone. It is unknown if the Bridge was later ever\nrebuilt or fixed.",

It was guarded by the tower of Barad Eithel.\n\n\nCourse\n\nSirion flowed southwards along the border of the Ered Wethrin, passing\nthrough the Fen of Serech before entering the narrow steep-sided valley\nbetween the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath named the Pass of Sirion.\nSirion then continued south into Beleriand, with the Forest of Brethil\nto the west, and Dimbar and then Doriath to the east. After leaving\nDoriath at Aelin-uial (the Fens of Sirion) it plunged below ground in\nthe Falls of Sirion at Andram (the Long Wall), where the ground fell\nsteeply. Three leagues southwards the Sirion exited the underground\ncaves at the Gates of Sirion. It then flowed southwards through\nNan-Tathren until it reached the Bay of Balar, part of Belegaer, at the\nMouths of Sirion.\n\n\nTributaries\n\nIn order from north to south, the principal tributaries of the Sirion\nwere the Rivil, flowing from Dorthonion until it met Sirion in the Fen\nof Serech; the Mindeb, which had its source in Nan Dungortheb and the\nEred Gorgoroth, the Teiglin, the Esgalduin of Doriath; theAros flowing\nsouth from Dorthonion and west along the Forest of Region (and also\ncontaining the waters of the Celon from the Hills of Himring and Himlad)\nwhich met at Aelin-uial, and the Narog, which joined Sirion in\nNan-Tathren.\n\n\nCrossing Points\n\nThe main crossing point was the Ford of Brithiach where the road from\nHimlad which crossed the Esgalduin at Iant Iaur crossed Sirion. King\nThingol of Doriath also kept secret ferries in Doriath to cross the\nriver.\n\n\nSettlements\n\nBarad Eithel, at the source of the Sirion in the Ered Wethrin, was a\nchief fortress of Fingolfin and his son Fingon, which guarded the pass\ninto their realm of Mithrim. Further south, in the Pass of Sirion, lay\nTol Sirion (see below). After the Coming of Men, the Edainof the House\nof Haleth made their home in the Forest of Brethil, and the Sindar ruled\nby Thingol lay secure within the Girdle of Melian in their realm of\nDoriath. At the outflow of Sirion into Belegaer, after the\ndestruction of Eglarest and Brithombar, the Havens of Sirion were built\nby Círdan and his people.\n\n\nIslands\n\nThe most important island in Sirion was Tol Sirion. The original Minas\nTirith was built here by Finrod Felagund in the strategic location\ncontrolling the Pass of Sirion where it entered Beleriand between the\nEred Wethrin and the Echoriath. Shortly after Dagor Bragollach it was\ncaptured by Sauron and the island became known as Tol-in-Gaurhoth.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nSirion is a Sindarin/Noldorin name which contains the element sîr.\nDepending on the meaning of the second element, the name could either\nmean “great river” or “land of waters” (-ion as augmentative suffix or\narchaic plural genitive suffix).\n\nIts name in Khuzdul was Gabilān, with the element Gabil - “Great”."

This is the home\n    of Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins and the site of the beginning and\n    conclusion of the novels _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_.\n    Sam Gamgee and his grandfather, the “Gaffer”, live on the lane of\n    _Bagshot Row_, below Bag End.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Bywater is a village a short walk east of Hobbiton. It is best known\n    as the home of two inns, The Green Dragon Inn and The Ivy Bush.\n\nThe Southfarthing\n\nA rural and fertile area, the Southfarthing is the site of the towns\nGamwich (original home of the Gamgee family), Cotton, Longbottom and\nmuch pipe-weed production.\n\n-   LONGBOTTOM, a name meaning “long valley”, was founded by Tobold\n    Hornblower with the introduction of pipe-weed, in TA 2670, allowing\n    the region to become well established due to the success of the\n    pipe-weed industry.\n\nThe Eastfarthing\n\nBorders on Buckland, contains the towns Frogmorton and Whitfurrows and\nthe farms of the Marish. Originally, the Eastfarthing was under the\ncontrol of the Oldbuck family. Even after these became the Brandybucks,\nthe farmers of the Eastfarthing followed the Brandybucks rather than the\nThain and Mayor.\n\n-   THE YALE is the name of the low-lying lands of the Shire's\n    Eastfarthing that lay along the northern side of the long road from\n    Stock westwards to Tuckborough. This seems to have been a sparsely\n    populated area, and in fact the map of the Shire in _The Lord of the\n    Rings_ marks only a single building here.\n    -   The meaning of the Yale's name is obscure. The well-known\n        English personal and placename “Yale” has its origins in a Welsh\n        expression meaning “fertile upland.” Its use may suggest that\n        the Hobbits who named it had contacts with “strange” languages,\n        possibly those of Dunland.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   THE MARISH is the name of fertile, yet boggy farmlands located in\n    the Shire's Eastfarthing. It is where the Oldbuck family is believed\n    to have lived before Gorhendad Oldbuck removed the family across the\n    Brandywine to Buckland and changed their name\n\n\nOther parts of the Shire\n\nThe Buckland and Westmarch are sometimes reckoned part of the Shire,\nthough they are not part of any Farthing. Buckland was described in\nChapter V _A conspiracy unmasked_ in Fellowship of the Ring as being\n_“virtually a small independent country.. a sort of colony of the\nShire.”_ Westmarch became part of the Shire only after the end of the\nevents portrayed in Lord of the Rings, in the fourth age.\n\nBuckland\n\nLocation, villages and borders\n\nBuckland is located east of the Baranduin (Brandywine) river. The\nhobbits living in Buckland grew the High Hay, a hedge, to protect\nthemselves against evil from the nearby Old Forest, which borders\nBuckland to the east. Buckland is bordered in the north by the Hay Gate,\nthe only entrance to Buckland near the Brandywine Bridge. In the south\nthe borders of Buckland follow the High Hay until the Withywindle joins\nthe Baranduin near the village of Haysend. The most important town of\nBuckland is _BUCKLEBURY_ where the Brandy Hall is located, home of the\nMaster of Buckland, one of the important officials of the Shire.\n\nAn important landmark is the _BUCKLEBURY FERRY_, a raft-ferry used as\nthe second main crossing point of the Brandywine River from the Shire to\nBuckland, after the Brandywine Bridge (which is twenty miles further\nsouth). It is apparently left unmanned to be used by hobbit travellers\nas needed. En route to the new house at Crickhollow, Frodo, Sam, Merry\nand Pippin crossed using the Ferry just before the arrival of a Black\nRider, who was forced to go around to the Brandywine Bridge as there\nwere no boats kept on the western bank of the river.\n\nHistory and Culture\n\nBuckland was settled around TA 2340 by Gorhenhad Oldbuck, the ancestor\nof Meriadoc Brandybuck. Gorhenhad Oldbuck thus became the first Master\nof Buckland. He renamed himself Brandybuck, which remained his family's\nname.\n\nBecause Buckland is east of the Baranduin it isn't part of the land\ngiven to the Hobbits by King Argeleb II of Arthedain. It was thus not\npart of the Shire proper until the beginning of the Fourth Age when King\nElessar made Buckland and the Westmarch officially a part of the Shire.\n\nThe Bucklanders are unlike other hobbits as they are prepared for danger\nand are thus less naive than the Shire-hobbits. They close the Hay Gate\nand their own front doors at night and are prepared to rush to arms when\nthe Horn of Buckland is blown. Most Bucklanders were originally of Stoor\nstock, and they were the only Hobbits known to use boats.\n\nThe Westmarch\n\nAfter the events of the War of the Ring at the start of the Fourth Age\nof Middle-earth, King Aragorn Elessar granted the Hobbits of the Shire\neffective self-rule inside his Reunited Kingdom, banning any men from\nentering the land.\n\nHe also granted the Shire a stretch of new land: this reached from the\nancient western borders of the Shire, the White Downs, to the Tower\nHills.\n\nThe area between the downs and the hills became known as the WESTMARCH.\n\nThe eldest daughter of mayor Samwise Gamgee, Elanor the Fair, married\nFastred of Greenholm, and they moved to the Westmarch. After the passing\nof master Samwise, they and their children became known as the\n_Fairbairns of the Towers_ or _Wardens of Westmarch_, and the Red Book\nof Frodo and Bilbo Baggins passed into their keeping, becoming known as\nthe _Red Book of Westmarch_.\n\nGovernmentally, the Westmarch was a region of itself, and like Buckland\nacross the river Brandywine it was not part of any of the four Farthings\nof the Shire."

The Great South\nRoad into Harad crossed the Harnen shortly after it bent westwards. This\nroad was used by Sauron's followers later in the Third Age.\n\nAt some point early in the 10th century of the Third Age, Ciryaher son\nof Ciryandil stormed across the Harnen with a large forced comprised of\nboth land and sea components. His combined expeditionary force\nthoroughly routed the Men of the Harad, and the Haradrim were thereafter\ncompelled to acknowledge Gondor's suzerainty over them. Ciryaher\nthereafter took the name Hyarmendacil — which meant “South-victor” — and\nas king was styled Hyarmendacil I. Thus the river was deeply\nimportant to his royal career. Indeed, it can be divined by the name\nCiryaher took afterwards that the river was, at least for Gondorians, an\ninformal demarcator of “southernness”.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Harnen_ is Sindarin, meaning 'South water'."

It was guarded by the tower of Barad Eithel.\n\nSirion flowed southwards along the border of the Ered Wethrin, passing\nthrough the Fen of Serech before entering the narrow steep-sided valley\nbetween the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath named the PASS OF SIRION.\nSirion then continued south into Beleriand, with the Forest of Brethil\nto the west, and Dimbar and then Doriath to the east. After leaving\nDoriath at Aelin-uial (the Fens of Sirion), it plunged below ground in\nthe Falls of Sirion at Andram, where the ground fell steeply. Three\nleagues southwards, the Sirion exited the underground caves at the Gates\nof Sirion. It then flowed further south through NAN-TATHREN until it\nreached the Bay of Balar, part of Belegaer, at the Mouths of Sirion. It\ntotal length was about three hundred and ninety miles.\n\nIn order from north to south, the principal tributaries of the Sirion\nwere the Rivil, flowing from Dorthonion until it met Sirion in the Fen\nof Serech; the Mindeb, which had its source in Nan Dungortheb and the\nEred Gorgoroth, the Teiglin, the Esgalduin of Doriath; the Aros flowing\nsouth from Dorthonion (and also containing the waters of the Celon from\nHimring and Himlad) which met at Aelin-uial, and the Narog, which joined\nSirion in Nan-Tathren.\n\nThe main crossing points mentioned in the Silmarillion were Brithiach\nwhere the road from Himlad, which crossed the Esgalduin at Iant Iaur,\ncrossed Sirion, and the Ferries of Doriath.

According to others, though, it was made expressly as a gateway\nthrough which to expel Morgoth. The following text describes the\ncreation of the Door in the _Ainulindale_:\n\n  _Thus came it that the Gods dared a very great deed, the most mighty\n  of their works; for making a fleet of magic rafts and boats with\n  Ulmo's aid - and otherwise had none of these endured to sail upon the\n  waters of Vai - they drew to the Wall of Things, and there they made\n  the Door of Night._\n\n\nPurpose\n\nThe Sun was to pass through the Door of Night as it travelled above\nArda. When the Sun passed through the Door, night would fall upon\nMiddle-earth. The Moon would then rise from its resting place and\ncontinue on its path over the Earth. The Sun would traverse the border\nof the Wall of the World, re-entering the world in the East, at the\nGates of Morning. At the same time the Moon would be sinking in the West\nand a new day would begin. At the conclusion of the War of Wrath, when\nEärendil the Mariner sailed to Aman to beseech the aid of the Valar,\nMorgoth was imprisoned outside the Door of Night. The following is told\nin _The Silmarillion_:\n\n  _“But Morgoth himself the Valar thrust through the Door of Night\n  beyond the Walls of the World, into the Timeless Void; and a guard is\n  set forever on those walls, and Eärendil keeps watch upon the ramparts\n  of the sky.”_\n\nAt the “End of Days” (which is referenced to even in _The Lord of the\nRings_ by Gandalf, Tom Bombadil, and others), Morgoth shall return as\nMelkor by breaking the Door of Night, precipitating the Last Battle\n(Dagor Dagorath).\n\n\nLocation\n\nA description of the location of the Door of Night is found in _The Book\nof Lost Tales Part One_:\n\n  _About the World are the Ilurambar, or Walls of the World. They are as\n  ice and glass and steel, being above all the imagination of the\n  Children of Earth cold, transparent, and hard. They cannot be seen,\n  nor can they be passed, save by the Door of Night. Within these walls\n  the Earth is globed: above, below and upon all sides is Vaiya, the\n  Enfolding Ocean. But this is more like to sea below the Earth and more\n  like to air above the Earth._\n\n\nAppearance\n\nThe Door of Night was likened to a huge gate of stone at the very edge\nof the world: the _Ilurambar_, invisible Walls of the World.\n\n  _There it still stands, utterly black and huge against the deep-blue\n  walls. Its pillars are of the mightiest basalt and its lintel\n  likewise, but great dragons of black stone are carved thereon, and\n  shadowy smoke pours slowly from their jaws._\n\n\nFate\n\nIn the _Book of Lost Tales Part One_ the fate of the Door of Night in\nthe West, and its counterpart, the Gates of Morning in the East, are\ndocumented as follows:\n\n  _For 'tis said ere the Great end come Melko shall in some wise\n  contrive a quarrel between Moon and Sun, and Ilinsor shall seek to\n  follow Urwendi through the Gates, and when they are gone the Gates of\n  both East and West will be destroyed, and Urwendi and Ilinsor shall be\n  lost._"

In\ndesperation and love, Amroth lept from the boat to swim to shore, hoping\nto find Nimrodel, yet drowned in the dark stormy waters of the ocean.\nBoth lovers died painfully yearning to find each other. In this way\nsorrow first came to the land of Lorien.\n\nUntil the days of the Fellowship, the singing of Nimrodel could be heard\nin the falls near where she lived. The voice of Amroth can similarly be\nheard when the wind blows into Lorien from the south, where he had\ndrowned.

Vast territory between the River Sirion, the northern mountains\nand the sea belonged to Finrod with the blessing of Thingol, Lord of\nBeleriand. Círdan was the Lord of the Havens of the Falas, the lands\naround the two rivers Brithon and Nenning next to the sea.

The\nMannish language was used in Brethil by the men who lived there.

The river was dried up by the early First Age\nwhen Gondolin was founded leaving a stoney deep-channeled river bed\nbehind. Intent on following his wife and son, Eöl found the Dry River\nand the Hidden Way and thus to Gondolin to stand before King Turgon.\nDuring the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Turgon's army marched to and from the\nbattlefield down the Dry River. Years after the Nírnaeth Arnoediad,\nTuor and his Elvish companion Voronwë traveled up the Dry River for many\nmiles until coming to the entrance to the Hidden Way. After being\nreleased from the captivity of Morgoth, Hurin sought out Gondolin but\nwhen he arrived he found Dry River blocked.\n\nWhen the city fell in FA 510, the survivors did not use the Hidden Way\nto escape down the Dry River instead using Idril's Secret Way to escape\nby way of the Cirith Thoronath."

    "text": "The ETHIR ANDUIN, otherwise known as the MOUTHS OF ANDUIN or ANDUIN'S\nMOUTHS, was the estuary formed by the River Anduin's egress into the\nGreat Sea of Belegaer, near the great Gondorian harbour of Pelargir.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIt was an area significant to the careers of at least two Kings of\nGondor, Falastur and Aragorn. The earlier king was the first to fully\nembrace the necessity of a strong navy, and through its use extended the\ninfluence of Gondor around the Mouths of Anduin. On March 13 3019,\nshortly before the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, some hundreds of\nfishermen went to aid Minas Tirith without a captain. Much later,\nAragorn vanquished a brief Umbarian invasion of the area. Aragorn, along\nwith Grey Company and the Army of the Dead, liberated Pelargir and the\nsurrounding Anduin estuary from the Corsairs of Umbar, after having\nprogressively pushed them out of the delta for much of that week.\nBecause the victory on 13 March was so complete, Umbar was left with no\ntools to effect its sovereignty. Thus, what might be thought of as the\n“Battle of Ethir Anduin” led directly to Umbar's reintegration with\nGondor in Aragorn's Reunited Kingdom.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe land on the delta was long settled by Men, and indeed it was a rich\nsource of Mannish culture. Part of the reason for this was because it\nwas contested between different types of Men, probably including groups\nlike the Nandorians and Haradrim, but definitely including\nNúmenóreans, Gondorians and Umbarians. Early Westron was said to have\ndeveloped there. The reason for the region's importance to the\ndevelopment of Mannish language was likely because the lands of the\ndelta supported Men of all stations in life, from lowly “lesser men” who\nwere largely fishermen and other folk dependent on the sea, as well as\nthe loftier Númenóreans."

The Citadel\nwould have been around 500 feet across.\n\n\nLayout\n\nThe Citadel is set out this way: In the centre is the White Tower,\nrising to a great height. Behind is the large sprawling King's House,\nwhere the Kings of Gondor once lived. In front of the tower is the Place\nof the Fountain, a courtyard containing the White tree and a central\nfountain. Around the Tower are ringed several other important buildings,\nincluding Merethrond, the Feasting Hall. The Citadel is accessed via a\nwide tunnel through the hill that leads to a small gate. The wide cliff\nnarrows to its point around 200 feet beyond the Citadel. As with all the\ncity's levels, the Citadel has a high wall and seven towers.\n\n\nThe Place of the Fountain\n\nProbably the most important symbolic area of the city, the Place of the Fountain was the\nhome of the great White Tree. It was a large circular grass area, around\n50 feet wide, with the White Tree being the central feature. The\nfountain was positioned some way before the tree. It flowed into a small\npool, then back round to the fountain. The Tree symbolised Gondor, and\nwas the flag and emblem of the City Guards. The Tree was grown from a\nseed of Nimloth, the tree given to the Númenóreans by the Eldar. It was\nplanted by Isildur, and grew to symbolise the blessings of Men. But in\nthe third age the tree was withered, perhaps symbolising Minas Tirith's\ndecline. It was only with the crowning of Aragorn Elessar that a new\nsapling was founded, showing the City's rise to glory under the new\nKing.\n\n\nThe Tower and other buildings\n\nThe Tower of Ecthelion is a tall white stone structure, rising 300 feet\nabove the citadel. The elevation of the city means it's topmost floor is\n1000 feet above the Pelennor Fields. It's name implies that it was\nprobably built by Denethor's father, Ecthelion, but it was possibly much\nolder. The Tower was used as a main business building, and contained\nseveral large council halls, and the imposing Throne Room. At the summit was the small\nchamber where Denethor kept Minas Tirith's Palantir. At the very bottom\nof the Tower, there were several rooms for the Guards of the City to\nlive and work in.\n\nThe House of Kings was a large building, with many halls and towers. As\none of the main buildings in the city, it would have been around 100\nfeet long. It was designed to accommodate the King and royal family,\nvisitors, guests and a large team of servants. The palace was no longer\nin use by the time Gandalf and Pippin came to the city; the last King,\nEärnur, having long since been killed.\n\nThe only other building Tolkien specifically mentioned was Merethrond,\nthe Hall of Feasts. This is where important guests to the city were\nentertained, and where important feasts and celebrations were held.\n\nThere were several other structures on the citadel, ringed around the\nTower, but none apart from the White Tower and the Feast Hall are\nimportant to the story of lord of the rings."

It ran 600 miles\nfrom its source in the Tûr Betark, in the mighty Káraskon Ravine, south\nof Ny Chennacatt, to its delta in the Bay of Ormal. The cities of Sirayn\nwere founded along the Sîresha river and its tributaries.\n\nMeltwater from two glaciers, as well as the torrential rains falling on\nthe mountain peaks, feed its upper reaches to create a fastmoving\ncurrent. The yellowish color of the water is due to the yellow sediment\nor loess eroded from the cliffs of the Tûr Betark. During Sadayn, the\nwettest season, a traveller following the foothills east from\nCiryatandor must detour north to the Mára Gaib (“Bridge of the\nOld-settlers”) to cross the flood-swollen Sîresha. This remarkable\nengineering feat bridges the river at the narrowest point between\nTartaust and Baud Selen.\n\nDropping through the Skara Riskál (“Wraith’s Teeth Rapids”), the river\nis joined at Tartaust by a small tributary and broadens to sweep\nsmoothly along the bottom of a wide gorge. The current passes rapidly\nthrough chasms carved from mesas and rock outcroppings as well as across\nthe vast plains of the scrubland typical of Chennacatt. Just above Rask,\nbefore the Maudar adds its flow to the Sîresha, the river drops in the\nSkara Sársus (“Cougar’s Gullet Rapids”), the last of the white water\nthat makes the upper half of the Sîresha unnavigable.\n\nThe lower Sîresha is a tamer stream, flowing between low banks and\nmeandering in ever greater loops as it approaches the Bay of Ormal. It\nshrugs once more at the ruins of Charnesra, where unusal rock formations\nin the river create lethal undercurrents and an obstructed channel for\nwater traffic. Young and daring adventurers sometimes brave the swirling\ncurrent, but more prudent travellers and commercial bargemasters still\nuse the old canal through the ruins to avoid the possibility of sinking\ntheir vessels.\n\nThe great forest bordering Isra, the Sára Bask, grows right up to the\nriver, its scrubby undergrowth and hardy trees overhanging the southern\nbank. Torbusaud (“Greenbarks”), slow barges of herb pickers, patrol this\nsection of the Sîresha to allow workers to efficiently harvest the\nwood’s bounty while still afloat. The lazy Sîrsis river flows between\ntrunks of the famous bausk trees (known for their bizarely corkscrewed\nlimbs) of the forest to join the Sîresha. The combined currents dump\ninto the Mard Isauba, a finger of the greater Bay of Ormal, at Tûl\nHarar."
